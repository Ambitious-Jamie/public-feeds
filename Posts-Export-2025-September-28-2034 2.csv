616,"The word is spreading","<p style=""text-align: left"">In the last few weeks it seems like the word is spreading as people have been travelling from all around the country to visit the eHaus. They have either visited the website and like what we are able to offer or have heard from one of our suppliers about this new approach to building. Typically they want to build an energy efficient home and want to see firsthand what that might look like.</p>
They have not been disappointed with all visitors saying what they have seen is brilliant. Because of this demand we have developed a consultation service to team up with you and your designer if you are outside of the Manawatu/Wanganui region.&nbsp; This means we take your proposed design load it into the PHPP software which is able to predict the performance of the building in terms of comfort and energy consumption. After this initial work we are then able to make adjustments if required to improve the performance. If you would like to know more about this service please email an enquiry or call Baden or Jon. For a small cost we can take out the risk for you and give you real performance data before you even start to build!

I have included a page from the PHPP software to give you an idea of the detail that is given.

eHaus is involved with one of the most exciting residential building &nbsp;projects in the country. It is of course a Passive House that is under construction, and now out of the ground, in Auckland. A team of professionals have come together to make the owners dreams come true. eHaus is responsible for the Passive Design in conjunction with Jessop Architecture. The process is, create the house design, enter this design data into the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) and then determine what needs to be done to make it perform to the standard. The team at Jessop's were great to work with as they were just as passionate as us to meet the customers expectations.

Along with Carters and Auckland City Council are a list of suppliers that have all been keen to support the project as it is so clear that this is the way of the future. I am contributing to a blog that is following the progress masterminded by Dr Paola Leardini at The University of Auckland.

These temperatures were recorded every 30mins and then loaded into a CSV file to generate the graphs. The heating used in the eHaus is a Pellet fire which has consumed 55kg of pellets in June. Translated into dollar figures the total heating cost for the eHaus in June was $30.25 when buying the pellets in bulk or $48.55 when purchased by the bag. The pellet fire consumes about 1.4kg per hour so the unit has run for about 40 hrs total for the month.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center""><a href=""http://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/average-temps.jpeg""><img class=""aligncenter  wp-image-1148"" title=""average temps"" src=""http://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/average-temps-640x349.jpg"" alt="""" width=""750"" height=""400""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: left"">This second graph shows the average daily temperatures recorded in June. The eHaus is generally 4 degrees warmer than the other &nbsp;house.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left"">The figures are one thing but actually living in the house is something else. One of the biggest difference to a normal house is the temperate swing is so much less, getting up in the morning is a lot easier when it is 18 degrees not 12 degrees!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left"">One thing to remember is this house is the first eHaus built and not good enough to reach the PassivHaus standards as it has insufficient insulation under the concrete pad. What that means is it leaks thermal energy more than it should. We currently have 3 more builds on the go that are to the PassivHaus standard so watch this space.</p>",,2012-07-11,post,https://ehaus.co.nz/?p=1133,https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/daily-temps-640x3381.jpg,daily-temps-640x338,,,,https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/daily-temps-640x3381.jpg,,"Passive house",,,,,,9,,60,2,,,,,,,,,"a:2:{s:7:""vc_grid"";a:0:{}s:10:""vc_grid_id"";a:0:{}}",,,off,,,750,7500,,,,16:9,,,,,,,off,Skinny,off,off,off,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,draft,2,Jon,info@ehaus.co.nz,Jon,Iliffe,actual-daily-temperatures-of-the-ehaus,,,0,0,0,open,open,2024-01-08

&nbsp;

Matthew Cutlet-Welsh of Home Style Green has just interviewed eHaus to have a listen click <a title=""eHaus Pod Cast"" href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/HomeStyleGreen"">HERE</a>  This interview came about through a meeting with Elrond Burrell who is an expat Kiwi Architect working in the UK. I met Elrond whilst over there recently and he showed me two PassiveHaus schools that he has been involved with. It was a cold day when we visited with snow still lingering outside Oak Meadow and even though the school was empty as it was half term it was warm inside. It is heated by two domestic boilers which is crazy when you see the size of it. But it works. The exciting thing for me is that they have achieved this building <strong>for no more cost. </strong>That is why they are very busy now with more schools underway around the UK. Just reminded of this by the cold snap here in NZ........We will build schools like this here too, its just a matter of when! Click HERE to have a look. If you want to listen to Elrond Burrell he is also on the Homestyle Green Pod Cast series.'

One of these homes has just been completed in rural Wanganui, demonstrating the supreme comfort through use of intelligent but simple design.  This show home has, again, been constructed in conjunction with Carters and the local eHaus building team who is now headed up by Simon &amp; Stacey Penn.

The house has been labeled by the locals “the black box” as from the road it could be mistaken as a flash farm shed. However stepping through the door immediately confirms that this is no ordinary country home.

eHaus believes in challenging traditional building and design by ensuring extreme efficiency and unparalleled comfort all year round. No matter what is going on outside this home immediately has the feeling of warmth, comfort, and quietness –  elements that the eHaus homes are quickly becoming known for.

This particular eHaus achieves a net zero energy status, which means it produces as much energy as it uses in a 12 month period.  Take the opportunity to view the house and you will be amazed by the low costs it takes to maintain a comfortable environment. For the first month the power used cost only $1.96 for a family of 5! The owners expect similar power bills for the entire year.

<b>This eHaus Zero is open to the general public for the first time on Saturday March 28</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b> from 10.00am – 4.00pm.  On Sunday 29th March we will be offering exclusive tours to potential new home owners - if this you please email </b><a href=""mailto:info@ehaus.co.nz"">info@ehaus.co.nz</a><b> to reserve a place.

2936,"Health &amp; Comfort ... are the claims true?","<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2939 size-medium"" src=""http://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/may-622x400.jpg"" alt=""may"" width=""622"" height=""400"">

My&nbsp;family have been looking forward to this time of year as we really get to find out if our new house will behave like eHaus said it would! &nbsp;We have been monitoring five internal temperatures along with the outside temperature from the beginning of the year and as you would expect the comfort&nbsp;has been great. But what happens when the outside temperature falls below 5ºC and the sun disappears for a few days? The graph shows exactly what happens, with virtually no heating (we have put the tiny electric heater on in the lounge for a total of 5&nbsp;hours so far this year!) &nbsp;the comfortable living environment continues. So the claims are true the house remains between 20ºC and 25ºC no matter what is going on inside and out. Believe me although I am a fanatic my wife and family just live the same way any other family does, lights left on, windows and doors left open, long showers, etc but none of that has much of an impact in an eHaus. The average indoor temperature for May was 21.8ºC and the average relative humidity 52. For a house to be healthy it should have a relative humidity between 40 and 60. Outside of this is where mould and damp can cause problems to the fabric of the building and the fabric of your body! To be honest I don't think the numbers really &nbsp;convey what it&nbsp;feels like so let me put it like this......

The showers and bathrooms dry on their own without the need for noisy extractor fans or opening windows. Towels dry on their own no heated towel rails required and no damp towels the following day. When you come home from work it is warm, no need to do anything it just is. No winter quilt or fleecy sheets required and no rush to get dressed in the morning, it's the same room temperature as in the summer. Of course if you want it to be cold no problem just leave&nbsp;the window open but honestly with clean, fresh, filtered air 24 / 7 why would you?

I said earlier the best way is to feel what it is like in an eHaus which is why we open the doors every other Sunday afternoon from 2pm to 4pm so you can feel the difference yourself.&nbsp;(next date is June 7th) Even better, when you visit you can&nbsp;enter the competition, with the prize of a chance to stay in the house for a night in August with breakfast provided.

Right now eHaus is designing &amp; building homes all around New Zealand, if you are ready to start your project or you want to find out more let us know.

The reason is to thermally insulate the floor and footings completely so the heat finds it hard to escape. Here is a thermal image comparing a standard NZ foundation to an eHaus.

2965,"now comes the Air Tight Layer","So now we have an unbroken insulation layer with no thermal bridging from the foundation to the walls. &nbsp;The next detail that will enable the eHaus to keep an even temperature year round is the Air Tight Layer. Every join in the house must be sealed, we are using products that have been designed specifically to&nbsp;achieve&nbsp;this developed by Proclima. The target for this house is to achieve an air&nbsp;tightness&nbsp;of less than 1 air change per hour of the total treated area of the house at a pressure of 50 pa. Most houses leak at the rate of 10-20 air changes per hour.

The reason for this is airtightness minimizes the amount of warm - or cool- air that can pass through the structure, enabling the &nbsp;ventilation system to recover the heat before discharging the air externally.

This&nbsp;does not mean that you can't open the windows!! Not at all, we have designed a&nbsp;beautiful&nbsp;indoor out door flow for use when the&nbsp;weather&nbsp;permits. But for the rest of the time you are able to shut out the cold or&nbsp;indeed&nbsp;heat when it is not wanted.

Open Building Solutions have been busy over the last 3 years developing a unique thermally broken range of aluminium joinery. We went on site to their testing facility to see how the windows we are fitting to the first eHuas performed when pressured and de-pressured to 50 pascals.

You can see in the video clip how the test was conducted and I am very pleased to say the results were&nbsp;excellent.

Results were all good....................... it is anticipated that when the final blower door test is performed the first eHaus will check in at less than 1 air change per hour of the treated floor area. If achieved this will set a new record in NZ!

2969,"Yes, we have broken the record for the most airtight house in NZ!","After a very busy month the first eHaus is finished and looking beautiful. The final blower door test confirmed that the house has an air change rate per hour of only 0.62 when pressured and depressurised at 50 Pascal’s. (Most new houses leak at the rate of 5-10 AC/Hr)

Far more than that the house has been monitored for the last two weeks and even though we have had some outside temperatures as low as 6°C the house hasn’t gone below 20°C that’s with no one living in it and no heating! I should be surprised as that is exactly how the PHPP software predicted the performance of the eHaus all year round temperatures of between 20°C – 26 °C with virtually no heating required.

We have also installed a clever device that remotely measures how much power is being used on selected devices and circuits. It is then able to show the cost of running these devices on a daily weekly monthly basis. The reason why we have fitted this is because the eHaus brand is synonymous with low energy and this is the best way to prove it with real figures.

Since the opening last weekend we have had an estimated 200 people look at the house with great feedback.

2976,"Back to School","Last Saturday 16 people from around the country met at the eHaus to learn more about how to build a Passive House.

Most of those attending were planning to build there own home in the near future and wanted to&nbsp;understand&nbsp;how it was possible to have a house that requires virtually no active heating and cooling but would stay at temperatures between 20 - 26°C all year round. The other big attraction to the Passive House standard is the savings in energy which are at least 75% when compared to a typical NZ house.

There were also 3 Architects and 3 builders on the workshop taking the&nbsp;opportunity&nbsp;to learn and gain License Building practitioner&nbsp; points or&nbsp;equivalent&nbsp;professionalism&nbsp;development accreditation. The day was filled with theroy and practical examples in an enviroment that was perfect (22°C all day....of course with no heating on!)

Baden Brown &amp; Jon Iliffe are planning to run more of these workshops in the future so if you are thinking of building an energy&nbsp;efficient&nbsp;home please register your interest by sending &nbsp;an email.

2978,"Pint sized homes","Recently read an article about alley homes, where housing is becoming an unaffordable option for people in cities. &nbsp;Vancouver is looking at building houses on propertys where single family homes are but using the laneway, the part of the property that normally sites the garage and alleyway. &nbsp;They are building minature family homes typically 45 to 90 m²&nbsp;&nbsp;to try and provide additional housing, these properties cannot be subdivided or sold&nbsp;separately&nbsp;but rented out to provide additional income. &nbsp;Therefore going someway to alleviate the much needed demand for rental properties in the city.

The homes that are being built are low energy houses, lots of insulation and triple glazing. &nbsp;The size of the homes means that they consume very few resources and have a low carbon footprint. &nbsp;This is exactly what eHaus is all about.

Webster Place, in Wanganui, is taking shape with all sections now sold and two more houses in the process of being built. Here is a picture of the section that is ready to build another eHaus on with a beautiful plan already to go.

When we choose this section they were all on sale but it was the best, providing a northern aspect for great indoor outdoor living. This plan has been designed to compliment the section, conform to the Passive House standard at a very reasonable cost. Contact us if you want to know more.

2987,"No Heating Required...... come and see for yourself","Thats right, since my family have moved into the eHaus there has been no heating required. The lowest outdoor temperature that we have recored so far is 2.5 degrees but inside the house it is a lovely even temperature. Every 30 minutes we are recording temperature and humidity readings around the eHaus house outside and next door in a normal house. This data will be available on the website in the coming months. It is hard to express comfort in terms of temperature alone. The biggest difference I have noticed is you are free to just get on with life not having to think about the living environment or do anything as it is always just right.

If you would like to come and see for yourself the eHaus in Wanganui is open on Sunday afternoons, you are most welcome to call in. We also have a growing number of alternative house plans for you to look at if you are planning to build.

Preparations are all in place for the next eHaus 1 day workshop on&nbsp;<strong>Saturday June the 23rd.</strong>&nbsp;Thomas van Raamsdonk will be one of the presenters on the day. Thomas is originally from Germany and has massive experience on topics like air tightness, thermal bridging moisture loading and healthy homes. He has done a lot of research in NZ which has resulted in a significant publication on Air tightness and moisture management. He will be taking two of the sessions in the morning program. This will include a demonstration of the Minneapolis blower door as you may have seen on the TV program&nbsp;<strong>Grand Designs.</strong>

As part of the workshop delegates will also receive a book published by the Passivhaus Institute. This is a valuable resource as it captures the Passivhaus principles in an easy to read but detailed format.&nbsp;Places are filling up for the day so please let me know if you would like to attend.

The date <strong>Sunday 11th November</strong> has been specially chosen to coincide with the <strong>International Passive House Open Days</strong>. Over the last 20 years, Passive House has become synonymous with quality, comfort and energy requirements low enough to be feasibly and sustainably covered with renewable. Owners and residents of Passive House buildings will be able to show members of the public just that by opening their homes and offices for this 9th annual International Passive House Days.

This particular residential building is still under construction but it gives you the opportunity to talk with others that share the Passive House passion and find out valuable information on how and why a house can be comfortable with virtually no heating requirement even when it is situated on the foothills of one of New Zealand's highest mountains!

According to the International Passive House Association...........

“The Passive House Days provides a chance for Passive House enthusiasts and newcomers alike to experience Passive Houses in all their variety, along with the comfort they offer first hand and see for themselves why all paths lead to Passive House.&nbsp;Private homes and non-residential buildings designed by a variety of different architects using various construction methods take part annually, opening their doors to the public. This annual event is a wonderful way to raise awareness about and interest in Passive House.”

If you would like to find out more please visit us on <strong>Sunday 11th of November from 2.00pm - 4.00pm</strong> on site at 61 Maunga Heights off Carrington Road. Or call Kelvin Pearce on 027 4485624",,2012-10-09,post,https://ehaus.co.nz/?p=2994,,,,,,,,"New Zealand projects|Passive house",,,,,,9,,30,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,draft,2,Jon,info@ehaus.co.nz,Jon,Iliffe,passive-house-open-days,,,0,0,0,open,open,2024-01-08

Now the winter is over and the solar hot water is providing most of the hot water we need the power bills are looking good in the eHaus we are monitoring. We purchase our electricity from powershop and they like others are able to give you a break down of how much power you are using. So it is good news when the Bill says it we are running at $2.15 a day. This is the total energy bill for a family of five! This has dropped from over $3.50 a day &nbsp;in the winter months mainly due to the solar hot water system supplying what we need and the cost of power is cheaper in the summer with Powershop.

The total heating bill for the winter comes to $209.44 for the wood pellets which we bought by the bag. If we buy in bulk that drops to $130.90 for the year. That is to heat the whole house with even temperatures in every room. We have not need to heat now since September and even with the door open for two hours on Sunday afternoons the indoor temperature is very comfortable.

Last weekend a visitor to the showhome remarked that it was a bit warm but I did point out that the large coat and woolly jumper was probably the reason! eHaus design ensures the temperature and humidity are just right and according to the world health organisation this means a minimum of 18 degrees C and a maximum of 25 degrees C with a relative humidity between 40-60. Whats brilliant is an eHaus can provide this all for less than $3.00 a day!

2998,"Kiwis want a healthy home that saves money","After 3 years in the making eHaus is now really gathering momentum. We are working with 5 new clients already this year...its only February! We are finding that a typical client is one that has read about Passive House or seen the construction on Grand Designs and realises just how much more it offers over a normal code build.

Our job is to understand your specific requirements and work this into a design and build process that gives certainty of performance along with function and beauty. As well as training building companies around the country we have been busy establishing a relationship with a team of 5 design companies. This solid foundation will enable the brand of Passive House called eHaus to be a viable choice for all Kiwis that want a <strong>healthy home</strong> that <strong>saves money</strong> through <strong>energy efficiency</strong>.

Having become Passive House certified in 2011 we have been developing our skills further and have become qualified to offer the Air Tightness Testing with the purchase of the first eHaus Minneapolis Blower Door. This was an obvious decision as each house we build has to be tested to ensure that it conforms to the standard. We are also able to offer testing as a stand alone service if you require this.

It was great to spend a day earlier this month honing our skills with the technical engineer from Zehnder who are one of the Passive House certified ventilation providers around the world. There have been challenges to overcome as with anything worth having but the gains once these are met and dealt with are so significant.

Dr Paola Leardini of The University of Auckland and I &nbsp;presented a paper that &nbsp;with the help of &nbsp;Renelle Gronert was written all about the history and rapid growth of Passive House buildings here in NZ. It was well received and sparked interesting conversations from other delegates from around the world. Altogether there were 34 countries represented at the conference so Passive House has truly gone global! I also had the privilege of representing the Passive House Institute NZ at the IPHA affiliates meeting along with the founder Dr Wolfgang Feist, Tomas O'Leary founder of the Passive House Academy in Ireland and America and other stars of the Passive House world. This meeting confirmed to me that the organisation is very much geared for growth as this was the central theme of the discussion. &nbsp;Another highlight of the conference was tours that had been arranged to view some of the latest PH constructions. There were 8 &nbsp;tours, I would have liked to go on them all, but only one was possible! We saw 4 completely different examples of PH buildings ranging from a newly refurbished 1960,s office complex to an Architects office which was totally modern combined with an accommodation block which was totally historic in style, the next was a 10 minute walk around a whole subdivision of terrace houses which were varied but all to PH standard and the last a building site where construction was half way completed of a 36 apartment block designed by a French Architect to be built in 5 different countries, quite incredible.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left"">As you can imagine I am so glad that eHaus has chosen this path only building to this incredible standard as all through the conference the same theme resounded..... buildings that are comfortable, healthy and save 80% of the energy of a normal building. Want to know more? Please email or give me a call.</p>

Last night the new eHaus website went live. The presentation is very crisp and now&nbsp; provides a very good platform to grow the brand. It is amazing how many inquiries we have received from the previous website and I am sure that will grow as we continue to refine our electronic presence. The new site has been designed specifically to run on tablets and smart phones&nbsp;as statistically this form of web browsing is&nbsp; continuing to grow significantly.

We have included the most recent projects and have plenty of space to add to these as each new project is completed. We have also added a eHaus licensed builder page which has the companies that have been trained to build to the exacting standard required by our brand. &nbsp;We will be adding a building company from the Palmerston North soon as two eHaus projects take shape there. &nbsp;If you would like to receive this news directly to your phone, tablet or computer just enter your email address in the box on the contacts page.

<h3><b>MIDDLEMARCH</b></h3>
The Certificate confirming this home can officially  be called a <b>Passive House</b> arrived last week from the certifier in Europe. This was received with much celebration in the ecoBuild Developments office!
<h3><b>CLIENT BRIEF</b></h3>
One of the delights of working with this client is he knew how to describe what he wanted but was then happy to trust us to turn his vision of words into a beautiful home. A great use of space has enabled us to fit 3 bedrooms, separate laundry, kitchen/dinning/living, library, office space and two bathrooms all into less than 150m². A key driver for the client was energy efficiency and although the Passive House concept was new, once explained it was rapidly embraced. It was no surprise to find that the client works for the Ministry of the Environment and so has a very good understanding of energy use and the cost to the environment and our pockets!
<h3><b>INTERNAL ENVELOPE</b></h3>
The airtight high-performance envelope uses an ICF (insulated concrete form) structure which has a seamless connection to the floor pad ensuring an unbroken thermal envelope that also provides the airtightness envelope. The roof is insulated with 3 layers of glass fibre batts and an airtightness membrane that is sealed to the top bracket. High performance triple glazed uPVC windows from Germany with a u value of 0.5 with a SHGC of .52 ensures the suns energy is captured. The shading ensures this energy can be controlled to prevent  overheating.
<h3><b>HARDWARE</b></h3>
The nerve centre of the home is a comfo 350 ventilation system with an inline 500W direct heating coil. The comfo 350 has become the preferred ventilation solution in New Zealand. Since eHaus fitted the first one in 2010  we have installed or specified 11 units with more in the pipeline. The hot water system has a 300litre tank powered by a two plate solar collector. This will provide all the hot water needs for ¾ of the year in sunny Wairarapa.

<h3><b>ELECTRICAL</b></h3>
The majority of light fittings use LED’S technology and the appliances have all been selected for efficiency. Cooking is a hobby so an induction hob and double oven were included  in the uncluttered kitchen.
<h3><b>FEEDBACK</b></h3>
One of the encouraging aspects of being involved in the Passive House industry is hearing the feedback from the clients. And this project was no exception, perfection is unobtainable but believe me this home comes very close. ""I am pleased that eHaus introduced me to the concept of Passive House, I knew I wanted an energy efficient eco-home without properly understanding what the terms meant. The outcome is a home built to the high European energy efficiency standard which is very comfortable.""

3009,"PHINZ makes the final cut in the Passive House Award 2014","It was exciting to receive the announcement that the first certified Passive House in New Zealand (PHINZ)  has made the final selection in the Passive House Award 2014. The winners in a total of six categories will be announced on the 25th April at the international Passive House Conference which is held in Aachen Germany. PHINZ is entered into the Single Family Home category and sits with entries from Belgium, Finland, USA and  two from Germany  This was our second project using the PHPP software which determines exactly how the house will perform before it is built. It was a great opportunity to work with the European Certifier and all those involved in New Zealand. Since this project we have developed our own design and building systems to deliver the best performance with the simplest execution. There will be a good representation from New Zealand at the International Conference in Aachan with Dr Paola Leardini from the University of Auckland and Kara Rosemeier who heads up Passive House Academy New Zealand (PHANZ), both having opportunities to present at the conference. We wish them well as we do PHINZ!

<h1>Hello from the eHaus office,</h1>
We have had a busy few months in the head office of eHaus.&nbsp; We have caught up with some of you at the Palmerston North, Wanganui, Auckland, Waikato and Wellington Home Shows.&nbsp; We have enjoyed sharing about the benefits of an eHaus&nbsp;and some of you have shared your dreams/designs and aspirations for your new home.&nbsp; Following on from these home shows, we held an information evening in each respective area and for&nbsp;those of you who attended, we hope you found the information helpful in your decisions moving forward. &nbsp;We love&nbsp;hearing from our clients how much they enjoy living in their eHaus and how pleased they are making the decision to go the PassiveHaus way.&nbsp; It confirms to us that this is definitely the way forward in the building industry!&nbsp; So, we are committed to spreading the word and making eHaus a well known brand synonymous with passive housing and low carbon foot print in the future.

Since our last newsletter we have expanded our team and welcome on board The Building Company (2010) Ltd on the Kapiti Coast, Chatterton Builders Ltd in North Canterbury and Welch Builders &amp; Construction Ltd in Hawkes Bay.&nbsp; A show home has commenced on the Kapiti Coast and one is proposed in Hamilton next year.&nbsp; We are looking forward to our&nbsp;input into the NZ construction&nbsp;industry in the future!

This article talks about some of the benefits of a certified passivehouse:
<h1><strong>Benefits of a Certified Passive House</strong></h1>
<em><strong>Knowing exactly what you get in the design stage:</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
certainty of performance due to detailed modelling and a stringent quality assurance process
<strong>Extremely low energy use:</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>
90 - 95% less heating and cooling energy use, 60-80% overall energy savings compared to a NZ Building Code compliant building
<strong>High quality indoor air:</strong>
Controlled ventilation for a continuous, consistent supply of fresh, heated, outdoor air
<strong>Comfortable indoor temperatures:</strong>
A minimum of&nbsp;20ºC&nbsp;all year-round, resulting in a dry, warm, healthy building
<strong>Operational and construction savings:</strong>
Vastly reduced energy bills; elimination of conventional HVAC &nbsp;systems; much smaller solar systems required to reach zero energy; durable, tight building shell for lower maintenance
<strong>Proven Sustainability:</strong>
60,000+ buildings worldwide, some zero and even positive energy. 25 year track record.
<strong>&nbsp;Helping the earth:</strong>
With buildings contributing 30% of all greenhouse gases,&nbsp;Passive &nbsp;Houses &nbsp;are exponentially friendlier to the &nbsp;environment because of &nbsp;their minimal &nbsp;energy &amp; fossil fuel consumption</em>

Moving forward:
We are negotiating with more ebuilders over the country as new builds come to fruition, so talk to us about your build.&nbsp; In 2016, it is our plan to have ebuilders covering all areas in NZ so you can be assured that we can deliver your dream home&nbsp;for you – wherever you are.&nbsp; If eHaus is your preferred option, go to our website&nbsp;<a href=""http://ehaus.us8.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=c3adddedec87033640c6e5600&amp;id=d2fce6d4b6&amp;e=19c99bbd0b"">www.ehaus.co.nz</a>&nbsp;and fill in the checklist under ‘my eHaus’.&nbsp; We look forward to journeying with you&nbsp;through the planning and construction&nbsp;of your&nbsp;new home.

Best regards
The eHaus team

2015 has been a very exciting year for eHaus with 18 new projects across the country from Auckland to Dunedin. We have also really enjoyed meeting so many people at the home shows and information evenings that we have attended during the year.

The latest completed eHaus has just received certification from the Passive House Institute in Germany this past week <span style=""line-height: 1.5"">and reinforces to us that we have customers who believe eHaus is the right choice, knowing that independent verification of performance is available.</span>

With the recent United Nations framework on climate change bringing more urgency to address the consumption of fossil fuels, the Passive House Institute were present at the conference with a presentation made by Dr. Wolfgang Feist, Director of the Passive House Institute, stating that ""Renewable energy is absolutely essential for climate protection, but better efficiency offers even greater potential"". With a third of all energy consumed by buildings, the adoption of the Passive House standard in Europe is one step closer.

We are excited about the future of Passive Housing in NZ. It makes sense to build with the future in mind and we are particularly satisfied when we hear how delighted eHaus clients are with their eHaus home. If you are still on your journey with building, we would love to chat with you about your project.

Moving forward, we are excited to announce eHaus head office is shifting into a more purposeful office in Whanganui where we can expand our team to include the Design hub and make better use of facilities. There is plenty of parking available for clients, business partners &amp; anyone else who wants to visit! More about this in our next news update.

The show home in Kapiti is taking shape and we are excited to be able to showcase this home in 2016. Our Kapiti Coast eHaus licensee - The Building Company (2014) Ltd are a driven team who can deliver your dream home for you. Be sure to watch when this home will be open for viewing.

3733,"March 2016 News","<strong>Greetings&nbsp;from eHaus</strong>

February has been a very eventful month for us at eHaus. &nbsp;Not only have we experienced a dramatic rise in public&nbsp;interest but we have also been busy settling into our new offices, as well as attending the South Pacific Conference in Australia recently. &nbsp;Jon presented a paper at this conference exploring how much more it cost to build an eHaus? - between 6-15% and if it was a good investment or in other words when would the extra&nbsp;investment pay for itself - between 8 - 17 years. Of course the main reason we are so&nbsp;passionate in this new way of building is the comfort it provides whilst minimising the impact&nbsp;on the&nbsp;environment. But also very good to know that it is also a sound investment.&nbsp;It was well received and a good topic for discussion afterwards. &nbsp;Investing a little more upfront for your home to maximise financial gains long term is the sensible option as well as contributing to the care of the environment. Home affordability is not just about mortgage payments, but also running costs for the life of the building.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kiwis are catching on to this concept fast judging by the interest that is forming and the growth in the number of projects happening nationally. Interestingly, the world's first passive house is now 25 yrs old and is still performing to expectations with the same families still living there!

<strong>What does the term 'passive house' mean?</strong>

The term&nbsp;passive house&nbsp;(Passivhaus in German) refers to a rigorous, voluntary standard for energy efficiency in a building, reducing its ecological footprint. It results in ultra-low energy buildings that require little energy for space heating or cooling.

<img class="" wp-image-3734 aligncenter"" src=""https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/300px-Passive_house_scheme_1.svg_.png"" alt=""300px-Passive_house_scheme_1.svg"" width=""346"" height=""294"">

We look forward to continuing our eHaus design &amp; build&nbsp;service to the&nbsp;New Zealand public based on these principles. &nbsp;We know our eHaus clients have enjoyed the cooler, even temperature in&nbsp;their homes during this hot weather season. &nbsp;Whether you want an eHaus Euro&nbsp;or an eHaus standard, we can deliver your dream for you. &nbsp;Give us a call at the office 063477220 or 0800EHAUS to speak to Baden or Jon about your project.

Enjoy the last of the summer days!

4194,"Allergies anyone?","It is interesting to note especially as we move into Spring, that pollen and dust mites are no longer a feature in a passive house.  This is a huge factor when deciding how to build your new home - especially if you or a family member falls victim to the ever present allergies that particularly manifest themselves around this time of the year.  A Passive House is a healthier house that controls dust and pollen associated with hay fever and other allergies. A Passive House controls humidity, eliminates mould and condensation which is associated with asthma and other respiratory illnesses.

Based on recent research, the ten most common causes of allergies are:<img class=""wp-image-4196 alignright"" src=""https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Spring_Allergies-.jpg"" alt=""spring_allergies"" width=""433"" height=""332"" />

With the specific building requirements that eHaus undertakes during construction,  most of these causes are eliminated with the installation of the highly efficient heat recovery unit.  This unit cleans and circulates the air in a room providing fresh pollen-free and dust-free air once every three hours and does not release ozone back into the air from the filtration process.   This maximises comfort for everyone, especially for those with allergies or respiratory problems.

It is definitely worth investigating if you are considering building and want to eliminate these factors from your living environment forever!",,2016-09-28,post,https://ehaus.co.nz/news/allergies-anyone/,https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/wheat.jpg|https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Spring_Allergies-.jpg,wheat|spring_allergies,|,|,|,https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/wheat.jpg,,"eHaus News|Passive house|Ventilation",,,,,,4,,60,2,,,,"A Passive House is a healthier house that controls dust and pollen associated with hay fever and other allergies.","Allergies not an issue in an eHaus",,,,"a:1:{s:10:""vc_grid_id"";a:0:{}}",,,off,,,750,7500,,,,16:9,,,,,,,off,Skinny,off,off,off,,false,,,,Allergies,69,,,,,,,,marker,,"s:2:""N;"";","s:2:""N;"";","s:2:""N;"";","s:2:""N;"";",,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Jon,info@ehaus.co.nz,Jon,Iliffe,allergies-anyone,,,0,0,0,open,open,2024-01-08

4349,"Electric Cars anyone?","It is becoming a hot topic in NZ at the moment that electric cars are going to feature strongly in the future. Why? Because they are much kinder to the environment and we at eHaus are very mindful about the impact we have on our environment. Here are five reasons why you should consider buying an electric car for your next purchase:
<h3><strong>1. You’ll save money in the long run</strong></h3>
Buying an electric car will save you money – and is only set to save you more and more as battery prices plummet due to the battery revolution. Electric vehicles are considerably cheaper to run than regular fuel and gas powered cars. The US Environmental Protection Agency says that electric vehicles require $3.74 worth of electricity to travel 100 kms, in comparison to the $13.36 of fuel required by fuel reliant cars. Currently, electric cars are more expensive in relation to regular vehicles. However, this is set to change as electric vehicles become more popular.
<h3><strong>2. You won’t be harming the environment</strong></h3>
This is quite an obvious one, but there’s never been a more relevant time to pursue a carbon neutral lifestyle – both for your conscience and your bank account. Buying an electric car will drastically reduce the direct environmental impact that a regular car causes. In addition, the growth of renewable energy is set to lower the emissions of electric cars even further by enabling the electricity they require to be entirely fossil fuel free. In light of a massive international push for carbon emission reductions, going green can pay off – quite literally – as governments dedicate more funding and subsidies to green initiatives.
<h3><strong>3. Prices are dropping</strong></h3>
Electric cars are becoming much more plentiful in the car market, and as electric cars release, more prices are slowly coming down – making going green not just affordable in terms of everyday costs, but also in terms of the upfront cost of the car. A higher number of EVs on the roads will also increase the demand for charging stations, making the issue of EV driving distance limits a much smaller issue.
<h3><strong>4. They require less maintenance</strong></h3>
Electric cars have 10 times fewer moving parts than regular cars.

With no engine, transmission, spark plugs, fuel tank, tailpipe, distributor, start, clutch, muffler or catalytic converter, electric vehicles are evidently going to require much less maintenance than their petrol powered predecessors.
<h3><strong>5. Electric vehicles compliment the solar storage revolution</strong></h3>
The reason for the incredible growth in both areas of electric vehicle and solar storage pies is no coincidence. In fact, solar energy and battery storage are creating incredible potential for streamlining green living from your home to your car. Solar PV power generated and then stored in high tech lithium-ion batteries can not only supply green energy to your home, but can charge your electric vehicle while it’s parked at home. Unsurprisingly, talk about partnerships between electric vehicle companies and solar energy suppliers is not far around the corner.",,2017-03-15,post,https://ehaus.co.nz/news/electric-cars-anyone/,https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/electric_cars_electric_vehicles_72.jpg,electric_cars_electric_vehicles_72,,,,https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/electric_cars_electric_vehicles_72.jpg,,"eHaus News",,,,,,4,,60,3,,,,"It is becoming a hot topic in NZ at the moment that electric cars are going to feature strongly in the future.","Electric cars a hot topic %%sep%% %%sitename%%",,,,"a:1:{s:10:""vc_grid_id"";a:0:{}}",,,off,,,750,7500,,,,16:9,,,,,,,off,Skinny,off,off,off,,false,,,,"Electric car",60,,,,,,,,marker,,"s:2:""N;"";","s:2:""N;"";","s:2:""N;"";","s:2:""N;"";",,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,2,Jon,info@ehaus.co.nz,Jon,Iliffe,electric-cars-anyone,,,0,0,0,open,open,2024-01-08

Here at eHaus we are experiencing growth like never before. Our teams of specialised licenced builders from Northland to Invercargill, are busy constructing and managing eHaus builds for those Kiwis to realise the benefits these incredible homes bring and with the future in mind. Talking of the future….

<u>New eHaus subdivision</u>
Here in Whanganui there are plans underway for a new eHaus only subdivision. This is a very exciting development for us as land for 20 homes, all built using PassivHaus principles are worked through. We will provide you with more updates and what this will look like as things progress. This kind of concept enables us to have input into what the future looks like - redefining the way we live. Considerations like electric car charging stations,smart charge initiatives and active assisted living, all add to what an eHaus build offers which in turn helps establish new communities and sustainable ways to benefit our environment. &nbsp;&nbsp;Artists impression of Stonebrook Estate below:

<u>Commitment to climate change</u>
It has been interesting to hook into the international news and see that only last week, France has made a goal to be petrol and diesel vehicle free by 2040 and carbon free by 2050. &nbsp;How we would love to see NZ commit to such goals, being a country that is mindful of lowering our greenhouse gasses. &nbsp;NZ emissions are lower compared to other countries and we have committed to being part of the global response towards climate change, but further commitments will be necessary to herald a change like France is making. &nbsp;Here at eHaus we are also committed to lowering greenhouse gasses, this is why we are so passionate about Passive Housing and the role it plays in the community and for our country. Building an eHaus not only has significant benefits for your own health and wellbeing but the environment too. It’s a great feeling to know that one build at a time we are making a difference, and contributing positively to this global issue right here in NZ.

<u>Homeshows and Information evenings</u>
It’s a busy time for our teams with regional Homeshows and Information evenings across the country.&nbsp;The stands are bustling with people as the interest in eHaus grows at incredible pace. The Information evenings held after each Homeshow, are a great way to learn more about the process and the technical side of the PassivHaus principles, as well as being able to talk directly to our team of experts and qualified builders. If you or someone you know is interested in attending an eHaus Information evening, call us on 0800 434 287 to find when the next one is in your area. Or visit us at your local Homeshow to find out more. &nbsp;Here is a photo of &nbsp;a&nbsp;full house at the recent eHaus information in Kapiti.

<u>Experience an eHaus ShowHome</u>
Go along and experience the consistently warm environment an eHaus gives. The team are there to help answer any questions and talk you through the home and the unique features that makes it an eHaus. The Waikato eHaus ShowHome construction is also well under way, and in the planning stages are the eHaus Show Homes in Hawkes Bay and Canterbury. &nbsp;It certainly is exciting times for eHaus!

<h3 class=""null"">Seasons Greetings from the team at eHaus</h3>
The anticipation of the new season is something so many&nbsp;look forward to.&nbsp; But as Summer starts and the windup to Christmas becomes a reality it's&nbsp;easy to get swept&nbsp;up in the need for a list and the looming timeline to meet deadlines.&nbsp; During this crazy time, it's great if you can, to take some time with&nbsp;friends and family&nbsp;to reflect about the year behind and the opportunities and learnings it has brought. Plus share ideas and dreams for the new year and the anticipation that brings.&nbsp;For many of our clients, this is the reality&nbsp;as their new eHaus becomes a home - so exciting.&nbsp; For others the planning is underway and the start of a new chapter is about to begin - equally exciting.

Here at eHaus the whole country is a buzz with builds and enquiries as PassivHaus principles become the design and construction method of choice for so many New Zealanders.

Our team has grown&nbsp;to keep abreast with this demand. The designHaus has grown taking the total number of designers to 15. This means we are able to offer specialised architectural PassivHaus design services throughout the whole country.

We are also developing our eHaus Builder network expanding the teams and further adding to new regions through New Zealand, with our newest region being Bay of Plenty - Tauranga

We have networks in Auckland, Waikato, Tauranga, Hawkes Bay, Manawatu, Whanganui, Taranaki, Wellington, Kapiti, Canterbury, Otago, Southland.&nbsp; If you are looking to build an eHaus check out the regional eHaus builders pages on our website&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.ehaus.co.nz"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-cke-saved-href=""http://www.ehaus.co.nz"">www.eHaus.co.nz</a>

The Swiss designed mechanical heat recovery ventilation system, G4 filtration, constant temperature technology, the highest German engineered windows and doors, super insulation, air tightness and thermal bridge elimination.&nbsp;Full individual design service and qualified eHaus Builder for construction.

In addition, the Euro standard can also support the optional PassivHaus Plus standard for those wanting to harness the suns energy for onsite power production and off grid solutions.

Interesting to hear this interview on mould and condensation on National Radio yesterday. Most of the conversation was on traditional knowledge that has no definite or definitive outcomes but in the last 2 minutes there is a ray of hope! Sounded like a mention of eHaus was on the tip of the tongue. After all, we have held events on the Auckland University School of Architecture Campus educating both students and perspective home builders about the PassivHaus design &amp; construction methods which eliminates mould and condensation creating a healthy warm living environment. Not to forget the incredible efficiency that PassivHaus delivers.   Click here to listen:  <a href=""https://www.radionz.co.nz/audio/player?audio_id=2018648736"">Radio New Zealand</a>

eHaus are New Zealand leaders in PassivHaus design and construction. We offer our clients a complete service, and give them confidence and peace of mind, bringing all their ideas and concepts to life through one seamless process. Our dedicated specialist designHaus team is based out of our central office in Whanganui. The team consists of a total of 11 designers, making&nbsp;designHaus the largest specialist energy efficiency designer team in NZ. Included in this team are are a national network of eHaus appointed designers throughout the country. This combined team ensures we have the unique and specialised skills required to meet the stringent PassivHaus standard.

How does the process work? To begin with, each client is matched to the appropriate designer for their project. The designer takes the design brief, begins the concept design phase and works with the client to complete the design. This is then brought to life through one of our 12 national eHaus builders, who are trained&nbsp;in the specialist construction of the PassivHaus principles.

The designHaus also has specialist engineers in the team who are responsible for the PHPP modelling. This vital part of the PassivHaus design process ensures the house will meet the PassivHaus standard.

The designHaus team is about to be increased by one with the addition of&nbsp;Lena from Austria. Lena has a Bachelor of engineering in Renewable Energy &amp; Energy Efficiency and is looking forward to working with eHaus for a period of six months. She is also&nbsp;looking forward to enjoying our snow boarding season and exploring NZ while she is here.

An exciting and beautiful new subdivision called The Rangitahi Project has just been launched in Raglan. This spectacular piece of land,&nbsp;developed by the&nbsp;Peacocke family, sets out to create an incredible new vision for this peninsula.

The idea to bring Rangitahi alive with relaxed, like-minded people aligns with the Raglan community ethos:

<em>“Raglan is filled with people who&nbsp;are inspired by nature. They are&nbsp;vibrant
and energetic, and Raglan&nbsp;should continue to grow that way”.</em>

eHaus were invited to showcase our product at the latest Rangitahi sustainability evening on June 20th.&nbsp;This sold-out event was excellent, and our presentation was well received&nbsp;by those wanting more for their build and an alternative to the standard building code.

The Rangitahi&nbsp;vision for diversity is refreshing. “We are looking for interesting types of buildings, so that the environment is diverse, just like the people of Raglan…&nbsp;We want to attract a range of architecture that respects the natural surroundings, anything from 1-2 bedroom houses to larger family homes...”

Check out the Rangitahi website to learn more about this project <a href=""http://www.rangitahi.co.nz"">Rangitahi</a>&nbsp;- stage two is also in the pipeline.

With the recent sale of the Kapiti expoHaus our Kapiti-based team are soon to relocate into new offices&nbsp;at 887a State Highway 1, Te Horo. We managed to squeeze in one last Information Evening on Thursday before the new owners move in and make themselves at home. If you are in the area feel free to call in to the new offices and talk to the team.

Plus, eHaus Kapiti are&nbsp;reducing&nbsp;their reliance on fossil fuels with the purchase of an EV (Electric Vehicle). It is out and about on the Kapiti Coast roads, have you seen it?

A recent interview with economist Shamubell Eaqub on TVOne Breakfast Show highlighted the opportunity for an improvement in the current standard of new code built homes under Kiwibuild.

Here at eHaus we agree. The positive health impact of better insulation and proper ventilation is too significant to ignore any longer. Shamubell Eaqub says the relatively modest upfront costs are quickly compensated for with savings in lower energy heating costs, not to mention healthier and more comfortable homes. New Zealanders deserve better.

We'd love to know what you think about the Kiwibuild scheme, so follow the link below to view the full interview, and let us in on your thoughts!

Developed by eHaus for New Zealand, the eHaus Pacific is the most affordable option available using proven Passive House building science. Modelled using PHPP (Passive House Planning Package), this measured performance happens before the build even starts giving you peace of mind you can live by.

Mechanical Heat Recovery Ventilation System - smart and quiet, working hard so you can breathe easy. 98% of pollutants are removed from the air along with maintaining the temperature of the home all year round.
Air Tightness - creating a beautifully quiet space, stopping draughts and air leaks - 2 air changes per hour n50 (code 5-10p/h).
Thermally efficient double glazed Low E &amp; Argon gas windows - no mould or draughts, also virtually eliminating condensation.
Significantly less heating energy required - savings of over 50% on energy costs (compared to code). Maximum heating demand s50Kwh/m2/a.
High levels of insulation which match your regional climate.

The eHaus Pacific although technically not a certifiable PassivHaus, is eHaus validated to verify proven certified performance, architecturally designed with you and built by a qualified eHaus builder.

The eHaus Pacific is the new way forward for all New Zealand builds.

At eHaus we have builds happening all throughout the country and we want to give you the chance to journey with us on a build near you. So we are introducing open construction days at key stages of builds.

Experiencing an eHaus is what sets it apart from a standard code built house. To see the construction, talk to the eHaus builder and the homeowner is exciting.

To kick things off our first Open construction day will be

<strong>Wednesday 24th October in Bay of Plenty/Tauranga
123 Leyland Road, Whakamarama Tauranga
4 - 7.00pm</strong>

Currently on schedule to be air tight by this date, with the high performance windows installed and ready for interior wall lining. The day provides an unique opportunity to see all the key PassivHaus features before being covered.

Enjoy meeting our eHaus BOP/Tauranga builders Paul Sadlier and Ross Brown and the home owners, to talk first hand about building the PassivHaus way.

Follow the eHaus Bay of Plenty Facebook to keep track of the Leyland Road progress, or keep an eye out via the eHaus Facebook page or the eHaus website for an open construction day near you.

We are excited to finally confirm that the Dunedin CoHousing Project is underway with a building contract signed last week. This has taken 5 years for the designer (Architype Ltd) in conjunction with eHaus, to get the project to this stage. eHaus is responsible for the thermal modelling and the construction. This is the 2<sup>nd</sup> CoHousing Project that NZ has ever seen – and we believe it will be a benchmark for the future.
<div>CoHousing projects offers all the modern needs/wants of a group as well as contributing to the economy by way of low carbon footprint. All of the units are self contained, and Passive House certified, meaning they will maintain a healthy 20-25 degrees all year round virtually needing no heating. The site sits in the middle of Dunedin and within walking distance to all amenities. Being World Green Building Week, it seems very apt to be able to announce the beginning of construction on this mighty project that will keep eHaus Otago very busy.</div>

Fine-dining and yoga retreat chef Damian Oehlrich has opened a new vegan-friendly cafe in Whanganui.

We celebrate with Ross and Julie Brown, our eHaus Waikato House Of The Year Regional Winners. On the night of the National House Of The Year Awards evening, the supreme win for the category went to a Queenstown home, but this home is a super star for eHaus and we&nbsp;applaud with them and&nbsp;celebrate.

This is what Master Builders New Zealand had to say about the house:
<em>""A world-class energy-efficient design defines this&nbsp;home on a rural lifestyle block north of Hamilton. The&nbsp;collaborative design with Edwards White Architects and eHaus&nbsp;ensured the home treads lightly on the environment&nbsp;despite its generous 252sqm footprint. Computer&nbsp;modelling before construction used local climate&nbsp;data to ensure ultimate thermal performance.&nbsp;The Euro from eHaus is built to the German&nbsp;PassivHaus energy-efficient building standard, the&nbsp;highest on the planet. The four-bedroom, two bathroom&nbsp;home is north facing for ultimate solar&nbsp;gain. Two living areas spill onto a spacious deck.&nbsp;The contemporary black brick and cedar, tie in well&nbsp;with modern designer kitchen, scullery, bathroom&nbsp;and laundry. German-engineered joinery, a solar&nbsp;photo voltaic system, hot water and ventilation&nbsp;systems and pumps, plus airtight construction make&nbsp;this a star.""</em>

5791,"What our customers are saying...","Simon Penn the eHaus Whanganui District builder talked to Harry and Mary about their newly finished ehaus:

<em>“You must be very happy to be back in a warm climate after living in Canada for all those years!”</em><em>
“Well actually, No! I have been colder in New Zealand.”
“What do you mean? Canada is much colder than New Zealand.”
“Outdoors, maybe, but not in my house in Canada. The central heating kept the house warm even when it was -15<sup>o</sup> outside. But here in Whanganui, it has been 6<sup>o&nbsp; </sup>inside some mornings!”
So, we decided to build an eHaus. At first, we were skeptical. Can we really have a house that stays between 20<sup>o</sup> and 25<sup>o</sup> all year round without any heating (except for a few very cold days in winter)? That’s what the documentation asserted. And actually, that is what the reality is.</em>

We have no regrets. The house has lived up to its promise. When the temperature dropped to single digits in Spring, friends who built at the same time as we did – with the insulation, double-glazing and so on,&nbsp; all up to spec – had to turn their heat pump on. We were still waking in the morning to 22<sup>o</sup> inside.

And it’s not just the warmth of the house. It’s also the evenness of the temperature throughout the house. We had a wood-burning stove in the house we first lived in and yes, it was very cosy in the living room. However, when we got up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet (which Gold Card holders like us tend to do) it was cold! But not in our eHaus. It’s the same temperature in every room!

.<em>...Would we build another eHaus? Absolutely! Would we build with Simon Penn again? Without a doubt.</em>

This <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/cohousing-project-page/"">co-housing project</a> is setting the standard for a new way of living for many New Zealanders and eHaus has been part of this journey for the past 3 years.

The project owners known as the 'neighbourhood' has been one of total collaboration and once completed will become the second co-housing project in New Zealand.

Co-housing is different to co-operative housing ventures in that residents own their private house and space, but there was a shared green space and common house.

All 22 of the homes will be certified Passive Houses meaning they can be guaranteed to be healthy comfortable and very energy efficient - fitting perfectly with the neighbourhoods philosophy for doing things better for the long term.

5795,"Keeping our little people warm","Monitory air quality factors that effect human health and well being is something that interests us at eHaus. Air quality is an extremely&nbsp;important issue. So we approached a preschool to see if we could place sensors around the centre to monitor the air quality and temperature of this standard code built facility.

The first evaluation of the monitoring showed some issues with temperature and functioning CO2 levels. The temperature dropped in the centre sometimes down to 11°C (9:00 AM), even in the middle of September. So we worked with the centre to set up a timer to activate the heaters and&nbsp;warm up the room before the kids arrived.

Temperature plays a big role in how we perform at work and play.
The NZ ministry of education, US EPA, CCOHA &amp; WHO make the following definitions:
<strong>&lt; 10°C</strong>
At even lower temperatures, the cold affects the deeper muscles resulting in reduced muscular strength and stiffened joints. Mental alertness is reduced due to cold-related discomfort. For all these reasons accidents are more likely to occur in very cold working conditions.
<strong>10°C to 17°C</strong>
Cooler environments can feel good and comfortable, but it can impair the performance of complex mental tasks such as math, counting, analysing things and judgment. Manual tasks are also impaired because the sensitivity and dexterity of fingers are reduced in the cold. All this results in a drop in productivity.
<strong>18°C to 25°C</strong>
This is the temperature range you would want to try to maintain indoors to stay comfortable.
<strong>26°C to 40°C</strong>
If you prefer to have a warmer environment, bear in mind that high temperatures are conducive for bacteria, mould or fungi growth. It is important for you to balance what you consider comfortable and high temperatures to minimise growth of bacteria. You can also open your windows to let the air circulate, provided that outside wind is cooler than indoors.

A certified Passive House has rigorous standards to ensure that a home will not drop less than 20 degrees and get no hotter than 25 degrees. Every eHaus is designed and constructed using the International Passive House design software to ensure this happens. This provides the homeowner with the assurance that the house will perform and create the ultimate healthy family living space to enjoy.",,2018-12-12,post,https://ehaus.co.nz/?p=5795,https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/bf6fad57-95ac-4c36-962d-64cb25712380.jpg,bf6fad57-95ac-4c36-962d-64cb25712380,,,,https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/bf6fad57-95ac-4c36-962d-64cb25712380.jpg,,"eHaus News",,,,,,4,,60,2,,,,,,,,,,,,off,,,750,7500,,,,16:9,,,,,,,off,Skinny,off,off,off,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,draft,1,brad,bl.tipper@gmail.com,Brad,Tipper,keeping-our-little-people-warm,,,0,0,0,open,closed,2024-01-30
5798,"HomeFit tool developed by NZGBC","Do you wonder what about the health of your home? The New Zealand Green Building Council have recently launched a new online tool to help you assess and correct areas of your home that will affect its health.

HomeFit is a no-nonsense, straightforward way to check if a home is warm, safe and dry. This is designed for Kiwis looking at homes to buy or rent, or for homeowners looking to improve their property.

Answer a few easy questions about the home, then access the local installer directory to help make improvements.

Whilst this online check is a great guide, it won’t, by itself, result in a HomeFit stamp of approval. Read more to find out how you can get a HomeFit stamp of approval.

<p><strong>Floor Insulation </strong><br>For the houses to be Passive House Certified, there are many standards they must meet.&nbsp; One of those is the thickness of the polystyrene that is used to insulation the floor of the houses.&nbsp; The thickness of the polystyrene is much greater than that of a standard build, which ensures greater energy efficiency. </p>

<p><strong>Structural Insulated Panels (SIPS)</strong><br>With the structure steel up for part of the High Street units, the Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) will come out of their storage area soon.&nbsp; <br>For this project eHaus chose SIPs as a product that would assist with the rapid construction of the project and combine the required level of greater insulation and air tightness which maximises the performance of the homes. SIPs consist of a sandwich of two layers of structural board with an insulating layer of foam between the walls.&nbsp; The result is reduced energy consumption, greater control of the air quality inside the home due to the high airtightness which means less allergens, as well as being incredibly strong for resistance to natural disasters such as earthquakes.&nbsp; </p>

6782,"Alva Street Units Floors Going Down","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An important aspect of the <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/cohousing-project-page/"">Dunedin High Co-housing project</a> is energy efficiency.  Insulation is a key component that will increase the energy efficiency of these homes.  The polystyrene floor insulation for the Alva Street units is currently going down and the thickness of the insulation is much greater than what would be found in a conventional build, to ensure maximum energy efficiency.</p>

<h4>Happy new year from the team at eHaus!</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have no doubt that you've made the most of your days off, lounging in your favourite place with a good book, or for the active relaxers, seeking daily adventure. However you do holidays, we hope you're feeling recharged and ready for another&nbsp;new decade and brand new year ahead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thank you for your continued support as we continue to redefine the way kiwis live. Having people like you with us on this journey is crucial in gathering the momentum that we need to make a real impact on the New Zealand landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The growth we see, as more and more Passive Houses are being built throughout the country, is what is propelling us into the new decade, and is such an exciting thing to be a part of.</p>

<h4>01. Last year was our biggest one yet!</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We saw huge growth in 2019, with more of an interest in eHaus and what we do, and more new projects started than any other year. To us, this is just proof that us kiwis are now expecting so much more from our new builds. We are excited to see that our nation is also becoming so much more mindful of our environment, sustainable practices and our responsibility to make a difference.</p>

<h4>02. Mould in homes</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The media spotlight has been shining hot on the need to build healthy homes. It's no news to us at eHaus as we have been building healthy, comfortable high performing homes for over 10 years! But it's so good to see the interest and gathering momentum, knowing the long term positive effects these homes are making on our families for generations to come.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A December headline in the Whanganui Chronicle outlined by region the people in NZ who have mould growing in their home – check it out to see how your region ranked. Because we now have an alternative, it’s something that we no longer need to accept. Mould just can’t grow in an eHaus as the humidity levels and warm fresh filtered air means it can't establish itself.</p>

<h4>03. Our 10th Birthday Winners</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the true eHaus spirit, this year we decided to redefine birthdays as we know them, by giving presents away! In December, we presented the major prizes to our 10th birthday winners. A massive congratulations to:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Richard and Philippa Cain – eHaus Euro winners – prize was Certification cost of their eHaus Euro up to the value of $6000<br><br>Lani Bishop and Regan Van Der Kley – eHaus Pacific winners – prize was Energy Modelling up to the value of $4000</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Congrats also to all of our monthly winners. We gave away free mechanical heat recovery filters each month in exchange for reasons why our clients love living in their eHaus'. Hearing the way our clients have redefined the way they live is what keeps us going, and saw our 10th Birthday Celebration wrap up with a bang.</p>

<h4>04. Double the number of Information Events planned</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our Information Events provide the perfect opportunity for those wanting to find out about the huge benefits of living in an eHaus, along with the nuts and bolts of just how they are designed and constructed. These events have proven so popular, that this year we are doubling the number we do nationally. This means that you have double the chance to attend an event in your region. We have already locked in the dates and will be running adverts in the local papers. To find an event in your area, check out our website for the dates and lock these in your diary as these aren't to be missed!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Open Construction Days</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The eHaus difference lies at the very heart of our homes, so we are opening more of our construction sites throughout the year for you to see the mechanics behind these healthy, comfy, high performing homes for yourself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The dates for these events will align with each project timeline, so stay tuned for information on our website and social channels, and hey if you still like to read the paper, we'll be in there too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h4>06. New houses emitting five times too much carbon – study</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We all know that we need to do more when it comes to lowering our carbon emissions – and our homes are no exception, being a large contributor to the effect. We spotted this article in ‘Newsroom’ where researchers have calculated how much carbon dioxide a typical new three-bedroom home can afford to emit&nbsp;in its lifetime without ruining the planet. Because New Zealanders tend to build unusually big and spaced-apart houses, their emissions exceed the ideal carbon limit which is bad news for us. However, we know that a space built to the Passive House Plus certified standard can be carbon neutral in operation ie the home will generate as much energy as it consumes - now that is a good news story.</p>

<h4>07. Green Credentials – knowing what's in your building products</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of us wouldn't smear a body lotion on our skins without checking for any nasties, but what about checking what your home is made up of before you move in? At eHaus, we think it's pretty important to know what’s in our building materials, so we've committed to aligning with suppliers who think the same as us and are dedicated to providing products that are good for you and the environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This has set us on a mission to establish the eHaus responsibility matrix based on 7 key indicators&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><li>Recyclable material</li><li>Contains recycled material</li><li>Nontoxic</li><li>Low Maintenance</li><li>Recyclable/recycled packaging</li><li>Recyclable minimisation</li><li>Reduced carbon footprint</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are proud to have joined with suppliers whose products fall within these indicators. We can't wait to share more information about this, which we will launch on our website.</p>

<h4>08. ANZ Healthy Homes</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are looking for finance, the ANZ Health Home loan package is what you need. They are raising the bar on the building standards and an eHaus, built to the PassivHaus standard, certainly ticks the boxes. You can apply online, or if you have any questions feel free to call the eHaus Central Office to chat about this.</p>

<h4>10. Sales of inefficient light bulbs plummet</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Supermarket sales of energy-hungry incandescent light bulbs have halved since 2015, a trend welcomed by EECA (Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority). However, Chief Executive Andrew Caseley says there’s a way to go before all New Zealand homes have switched to energy efficient and climate-friendly LEDs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“These trends are very encouraging because LEDs save households money and contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through reduced energy use. If 100,000 more New Zealanders switched all their household lighting to LEDs, that would prevent 1,669 tonnes of C02 being released into the atmosphere per year – that’s equivalent to roughly 35,000 people not flying from Auckland to Wellington per year.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>EECA’s Gen Less campaign encourages uptake of LEDs as an easy way for New Zealanders to reduce their carbon footprint. Mr Caseley says the message about the benefits of LEDs is getting through but he would like to see households replacing more of their lights with LEDs.</p>

<h4>Morena and welcome to our eHaus Spring Newsletter</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ah Spring, we love your longer day light hours, and your fresh spring air - and what a fresh few weeks we have already had here at eHaus as we have been challenged with new ideas and new projects!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this edition, we look at the international campaign for World Green Building Week. After the recent commitment from NZ to the Paris Agreement, we share how eHaus is contributing to this. We all want to leave our beautiful country better than how we found it, so this requires a definite shift in our thinking in our approach to all aspects of life. We are committed to re-evaluating everything we do as a Company. This newsletter is flavoured with this theme as we go into this week. Happy World Green Building Week!</p>

<h4>01. World Green Building Week</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 23rd of September marks the start of World Green Building Week, with this year’s theme #buildinglife. So, what is this week all about? “World Green Building Week is an annual campaign that motivates and empowers us all to deliver greener buildings”. This year’s focus is to raise awareness of carbon emissions from all stages of the buildings life-cycle and encourage new practises and new ways of thinking to reduce carbon emissions from buildings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are planned events happening all over the globe, which we think is very cool. As our contribution, eHaus Hawkes Bay are having an Information Evening in our brand new expoHaus, built to the PassivHaus classic standard, and this will be the first event to be held there!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are keen to hear all about building the PassivHaus way – register with sharonw@eHaus.co.nz</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also join in the conversation using the hashtags <strong>#buildinglife</strong> and <strong>#WGBW2019</strong>. You can even make pledges like “This World Green Building Week, I’m building a better future by pledging to cut my energy use by 20% over a year.”</p>

<h4>02. NZ's first PassivHaus straw house</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What a great story from Jessica and Ben Eyers of Hiberna, who are building New Zealand’s first certified PassivHaus straw house.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""customTextColor"":""#8ebf3f""} -->
<p style=""color:#8ebf3f"" class=""has-text-color""><strong>""We feel it is like the crux of everything, the holy grail of sustainable building. There are no others in New Zealand and only a handful of straw bale Passive Houses in the world”, </strong>Jessica says.</p>

<h4>03. What a load of old rubbish</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We couldn’t believe it when we read, recently, that construction and demolition waste represents up to 50% of all waste to landfills in New Zealand! In one year, that would see NZ’s construction and demolition responsible for 1.7 million tonnes of waste being put into our precious soil. As a company, everything we do has always been built upon the belief that our environment is our priviledge, and protecting it our responsibility. Thus, ‘GreenHaus’ was born. GreenHaus is a working group made up of our regional eHaus builders and admin teams, looking at ways we can reduce our waste. We are committed to reducing our onsite and office rubbish by 20% over the next 12 months which is quite a target, but we are well on our way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, the most obvious place to start is to not generate any rubbish at all, so we seek to partner with vendors who, like us, have the same drive for whole, sustainable practices. VYNCO for example, who is an in-house team of engineers, have researched and developed a unique eco-packaging solution to help reduce waste using moulded fibre packaging – no cardboard inserts and paperless instructions. Along with this, their Urban Switchgear range products are wrapped in a unique tea bag style wood pulp tissue instead of a plastic bag. Great work VYNCO, big tick from eHaus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our team have been busy collating information across the country, sorting onsite rubbish, making changes and finding solutions to avoid rubbish from an eHaus build going into landfill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of the exciting ways our teams in Taranaki, Wairarapa, Manawatu, Hawkes Bay and Whanganui District we are making changes:</p>

<p>If you are looking for finance, the ANZ Health Home loan package is what you need. They are raising the bar on the building standards and an eHaus, built to the PassivHaus standard, certainly ticks the boxes. You can apply online, or if you have any questions feel free to call the eHaus Central Office to chat about this.</p>

<h4>05. House and land opportunities around the country</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are proud to showcase three new subdivisions that eHaus are involved with:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>01. Regaru –</strong> near Matakana, this subdivision has six amazing lifestyle blocks on land that has been organically restored – check out their website for more information <strong>rengarusolarvillage.co.nz</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>02. Auranga –</strong> based in Karaka. Drury Auckland is putting the heart back into modern communities. Auranga is a place that is safe for kids to explore freely, where there’s room to move, time to enjoy life and chances to meet new friends. Our new eHaus Auckland expoHaus is to be built in Auranga and this new community will eventually have 35,000 new homes. eHaus Auckland/Brant Homes is one of six building companies that has been hand selected to be part of this development. To check out more information,  visit <strong><a href=""http://www.auranga.co.nz"">auranga.co.nz</a></strong></p>

<h4>06. eHaus presents to the Government</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two of our team, Glenda Brown and Shelley Cresswell, recently presented to the Government Zero Caron sub-committee in Palmerston North, after submitting a paper on the topics they were allocated 10 mins to present.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What a fantastic opportunity to be able to present the PassivHaus principles as an immediate solution to a reduction in our carbon emissions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The paper supported the New Zealand Green building council’s paper for a building commissioner to be appointed as part of the team that will drive through this bill. Our industry is a specialised field, and requires someone who understands the current standards and can be part of the considerations in bringing about change. Nothing like taking your story right to the top! We are so looking forward to seeing what happens in this space.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>09. Have Spring allergies got you sneezing?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We know that not everyone welcomes in spring with open arms, especially those who suffer from allergies. September is the Asthma and Respiratory Foundation New Zealand Breathe Better campaign. Over the month, the foundation raises awareness for over 700,000 kiwis who live with asthma or other respiratory illness. and gather some vital funds to support them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Everyday Hero Better Breathing Challenge is created to encourage people to get out, get active, and improve their respiratory health. This could be as simple as walking around the block once a day, practicing some daily yoga, or running a marathon; whatever pushes you to raise awareness and improve your own health. We think this initiative is awesome, and get behind anything that offers relief to our allergy sufferers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A huge benefit of living in a PassivHaus is the healthy, clean environment. Thanks to the smart mechanical heat recovery systems that work in our homes, 98% of pollutants and allergens are removed from the air. This not only creates fresh filtered air but a completely dust free safe environment, so you can save on the tissues during hay fever season! Even if you don’t have a PassivHaus, installing a ventilation system in your home will improve your air quality and stop those allergies at the door.</p>

<p><a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/about-passivhaus/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label=""Passive House (opens in a new tab)"">Passive House</a> is well known for providing a <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/comfort/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label=""warm comfortable home (opens in a new tab)"">warm comfortable home</a> not only when its cold outside like the temperatures can get in Christchurch but also when a good old north westerner is driving in the heat during the summer months.&nbsp; Did you know there are <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/projects/"">examples of Passive House buildings</a> in the extreme cold like Zermatt in Switzerland at -20 degrees and even the Antarctic at -50 degrees. But there are also many examples of Passive houses in extreme heat like the Middle East +50&nbsp;degrees, Spain +40 degrees and Australia +40degrees! So how does an eHaus work when it is 30+ degrees outside?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The thing we love about Passive House is that it is all based on proven science principles, meaning the standard is the same anywhere in the world. We think that’s pretty cool. Sure the original thinking by Prof Wolfgang Fiest was how to stay warm in a cold German winter, but&nbsp;essentially the same&nbsp;science&nbsp;that keeps you warm in winter keeps you cool in summer. That is why Passive House is so much more than just a Passive Solar design. &nbsp; So no matter what’s happening outside your eHaus will stay at an even temperature with little to no heating or cooling, making it a <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/energy/"">very energy efficient home</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simply put- with every eHaus we consider the local
climate data and how each house will perform in the extremes of both winter and
summer. There are lots of key principles that are factored in but the starting
point for every passive house design is a thermal envelope that
essentially&nbsp;isolates&nbsp;us from the&nbsp;outside&nbsp;temperature, when
you get this right the summer and winter temperature changes have little
impact.&nbsp; This means that your passive home is designed specifically for
your site and the region you live in.&nbsp;</p>

The biggest thing we have noticed from doing this on every project for the last 3 years, is that there are less rules of thumb than we thought, and it is important to look at each project and the construction options available relative to the design/site and clients expectations and brief.""</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windows are a critical part of every PassivHaus design because they have a direct impact not only on the aesthetics, natural light, and the cost of your new home but the performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next in our <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/category/designhaus/"">designHaus</a> series, we interviewed one of our team of expert Architects and Designers, Sian Taylor, Architect &amp; Certified Passive House Designer from <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/designer/team-green-architects/"">Team Green Architects</a>, on the topic of Passive House Windows and asked her.....</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What factors do you need to consider getting that balance right?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“This is the biggest ticket item of the project, and the item which makes the most difference to both the thermal equation and the aesthetics of the project, or signal to all that this is a different sort of house. We look at the energy modelling on each project on a case by case basis, and consider the impact the windows will make, then give the client options, relative to the benefit (both tangible and intangible) that they will receive.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here at eHaus the choice of windows is determined by the fit to the climate region, the eHaus performance target (e.g. air tightness, thermal bridges) and the client’s budget.</p>

<p>Next in our designHaus series, we interviewed <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/designer/glenn-murdoch/"">Glenn Murdoch</a>, Architectural Designer from Theca Architecture in Christchurch.<br><br>At eHaus we are seeing more clients now placing health and comfort at the top of their list of must haves when discussing the design of their new home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>As a designer have you seen a shift in the focus placed on health and comfort requirements?   What do you do to ensure that criteria is met?</strong><br><br><em>“I think the conversation is yet to move to health and comfort.  People are still focused on ‘energy-efficiency’ as the metric they use, whatever that might mean for them.  For some people it means being warm, for some it means being cool, for some it just means not having condensation on their windows.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>All these people are actually talking about health and comfort, they just don’t realise it.  We work to reframe the conversation to be focused on health and comfort rather than energy-efficiency.  This allows us to take the conversation into other directions with a health and comfort foundation, such as the way your home makes you feel, how it might improve your metal health, how its carbon footprint can be lesser.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>eHaus achieves the <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/comfort/"">health and comfortable requirements</a> as every room in an eHaus is between 20-25 degrees, all year round.  The air quality is extremely high with 98% of pollen removed from the air.  There is no mould, dust or condensation in an eHaus.  This all makes for comfortable and healthy living.</p>

8514,"eHaus is Supporting Kiwis to Breathe Freely","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>eHaus are pleased to announce their support for Asthma and Respiratory Foundation NZ (ARFNZ), who today launch their new business sponsorship programme ‘Friends of the Foundation’, with eHaus the first Gold Friend to come on board.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ARFNZ is a registered charity and is reliant on community grants, sponsorships, and donations to operate. The Foundation plans to form partnerships with likeminded businesses who share the same values of improving respiratory health for New Zealanders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“In the COVID-19 environment, raising awareness of good respiratory health is more important than ever</em>” says Letitia Harding, Chief Executive, ARFNZ.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One in seven children, and one in eight adults have asthma in New Zealand, with unhealthy housing conditions a key contributor to these statistics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shelley Cresswell, National Marketing Manager, eHaus – New Zealand leaders in Passive House design and construction, stresses that these are statistics that we cannot ignore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“Constructing the healthiest, energy efficient homes is our goal, and the work the Foundation does is a perfect fit for us. We are really proud to be partnering with them and offering some solutions for the respiratory health of New Zealanders.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“It’s great to have ‘Friends’ out there who know the value of a healthy home and lifestyle and its ability to reduce the impact of respiratory illnesses” says Letitia.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Friends of the Foundation sponsorship programme focusses on supporting initiatives including education, raising awareness in the community, supporting those with a respiratory condition, and leading respiratory best practice for healthcare professionals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“The need for these initiatives is wide-spread across our communities”&nbsp;</em>says Letitia,<em>&nbsp;“Forming mutually beneficial relationships with businesses will ensure that we can continue to reach those who need them most.</em></p>

8662,"New Zealand's First Low Carbon Concrete Floor Slab Poured","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Zealand's first low carbon concrete with D5 Green was poured in Nelson last week. It was a 49m3 floor slab for an eHaus PassivHaus which kicked off a new partnership between eHaus and Neocrete. Neocrete NZ supply D5 Green - an innovative admixture to concrete that improves its performance and reduces its carbon footprint.<br><br>With D5 Green, over 1.5 ton reduction in embodied carbon of the floor slab was achieved (the equivalent of a return flight between Paris and New York). This was through reduction in cement and removal of other carbon-intensive admixtures and replacing them with D5 Green at only 3% of cement (around 370 kgs of D5 Green in total). A very promising result, given very limited solutions available in NZ for carbon reduction for concrete.</p>

8734,"Should our social housing be passive?","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Radio New Zealand interviewed Amy Tankard, Chief Executive of the Passive House Institute.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The great thing about passive house is it can be modelled in advance, before the building is built and so you can see how the building will perform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Rather than making iterative changes or adding a little bit of insulation or adding some better windows you can actually model the whole building system and ensure that it will perform as expected.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the government wants to achieve its standard for healthy homes, investing in passive upfront makes sense, she says.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The government has said they want to see all houses warm, dry and healthy, so if you go in with this high standard which is tried and tested both overseas and in New Zealand then you know you’re making an investment for the future.”</p>

<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The process is relatively simple, she told&nbsp;<em>Nine to Noon</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The only difference about passive house to conventional build is that we have a very prescriptive and rigorous requirement in terms of quality and quality assurance.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There’s a simple spreadsheet where we input all the data that basically guarantees that we will deliver a high performing building.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the principles of passive houses are followed methodically it doesn’t require specialist builders or designers, she says.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m really keen to bust the myth in terms of passive house being very sophisticated. It’s sophisticated in as much as it’s delivering high performance buildings but it’s actually very simplistic to apply.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the UK a passive house costs between 4 and 9 percent more to build, she says. Typically, that would be recovered in the first 10 years through energy savings.</p>

<h4>01. eHaus Hawkes Bay's Showhome Win</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our newest showhome in Hawkes Bay, built by Sharon and Ian Welch, was officially opened late November. Receiving the Passive House classic standard, this home in Havelock North is a first. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Baden Brown eHaus Director went across to the Bay to cut the ribbon and celebrate with Sharon and Ian who also opened the home for the public to see. The event generated quite a storm with so many people registering to have a look through.</p>

<p>Not only is this home the first certified Passive House for the Hawkes Bay, but it’s also a Multi-Award winner. Taking a Gold in the Master Builds 2020 awards, it also scooped up the Regional Category Winner Award, an award for Lifestyle for Sustainable Excellence and then the coveted Craftsmanship Award. This build is a true reflection of Ian and Sharon’s reputation for excellence. Four awards in one night confirms what we already know about this home – that it’s a star.</p>

<h4>02. Events for 2021</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Events are back on the calendar and it's been so good to talk to people about Passive House and what eHaus does again. We are finding that kiwis are shifting their thinking and want more from their new build, so the interest in building an eHaus is high. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Open Construction Days – Seeing an eHaus under construction just makes sense to appreciate the detail and mechanics behind these incredible spaces. We have Open Construction Days already planned for 2021 across the country. We post these events on our social media pages and ads in the local papers, so keep an eye out for an event near you and visit the team, chat to our wonderful clients about their build and see first-hand.</p>

<h4>04. The Carbon Debate</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reducing our Carbon is high on the agenda and rightly so. It's fantastic to know that New Zealand is committed to reducing our carbon emissions. We have crunched the numbers and wanted to share a fun fact with you.<br><br>Did you know that an eHaus certified to the Passive House standard uses up to 90% less heating.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, the average code-built home needs approx. 20kW of heating in the winter - by comparison, an eHaus needs only 2kW.&nbsp;Multiply this by 100 days of heating in the winter and the cost comparison for the standard code-built home equals $600, whereas the eHaus is a mere $60!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now the fun bit. The carbon emitted depends on the heat source, if it is gas it will be more carbon consumed than electricity. But let’s stick with electricity for this example. Each kW of electricity used equates to 110grams of carbon currently in NZ. So, for yearly heating the standard code built home emits 220kg of carbon compared to just 22Kg in an eHaus. We think that’s pretty cool.</p>

<h4>05. We are celebrating at 99!</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given it has been a funny old year with so many rules changed, so we decided to make 99 the new 100.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are so proud to celebrate our 99th eHaus build. It's crazy to think there are 99 New Zealand families whose lives and lifestyles are changed through the choice to build a home using the Passive House principles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We surprised our 99th clients with flowers to let them know this and talk about their eHaus journey and what they are most looking forward to when their home is finished.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I guess this might raise the question who then will be our 100th build? Well will have to wait and see the answer to that! Keep an eye out on our social channels for a video that captures the moment.</p>

<h4>07. What's the perfect temperature?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This fantastic article from Gareth Morris – Multi Comfort Concept Developer tackles the debate about the different indoor temperatures and why men and women disagree.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our bodies instinctively want to minimise the effort it takes to adapt our internal temperature, and we generally feel more comfortable if we’re in an environment that suits our thermal preferences and we’re able to control the temperature.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on top of that, it’s important to have a consistent air temperature throughout a home. If our feet feel colder than our upper body, or we can sense a cool draught coming from somewhere, then that will lead us to feel uncomfortable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, when designing and building homes, we must consider how&nbsp;project-specific variables&nbsp;such as location, orientation and building type can influence factors such as radiant temperature, humidity and air velocity – all things which contribute to our thermal comfort.”</p>

10638,"Energy Efficiency over Energy Generation – The Carbon Debate","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We live in a beautiful country, actually we live on a pretty amazing planet, but it’s under threat and we need to act pretty quickly if we want to keep it this way.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are grappling at a global level with a problem that has been known for many years - unsustainable levels of carbon in the atmosphere. This problem is damaging our planet in ways that threaten our existence and the cost is unimaginable.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here in New Zealand we are in the middle of an unprecedented building boom not seen before. This boom provides us with an opportunity to seize the chance to decarbonise our buildings and drive our mindset to one of Energy Efficiency over Energy Generation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every new building built to the current New Zealand building code will continue to require significant heating through the winter and for many, air conditioning in the summer, locking in a continued reliance on high energy consumption for thousands of families for the next 50 years and further destruction of our environment for generations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have been fortunate to inherit from a previous generation the significant investment in clean energy but as our consumption increases year on year the hydro’s often struggle due to a lack of rain with changes in our climate through droughts. This can mean our backup relies on fossil fuelled energy plants to make up the shortfall. Now that all sounds terrible (and it totally is), but there is a solution!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>High performing energy efficiency in buildings. We have the knowledge to design and build spaces that consume a significantly (up to 90% - yes you are reading that correctly) less amount of heat energy by following an energy standard that has been around for 30 years called <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/who-we-are/passive-house-faqs/"">PassivHaus</a>. Not only does the standard deliver transformational thermal energy reductions, but it also delivers healthy, warm buildings along with proven financial savings. It’s called the triple bottom line. People, Planet, Profit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>In 2013 the Urban Co-housing Otepoti was formed, and over a period of 6 years the group developed and refined their ideas and requirements into an economically viable, energy efficient co-housing development project.  The group purchased a 5,000 sqm site that was the former High Street Primary School and in November 2018, eHaus Otago commenced construction.  The project is New Zealand’s second largest co-housing development, and the first passive house certified co-housing development.  </p>

<p>The development contains 21 Passive House homes including 2,3,4 &amp; 5 bedroom homes. Built to the Passive House Standard, each home has triple glazing, thicker wall construction, superior insulation than new conventionally built houses as well as being designed to ensure they meet the Passive House air tightness standard. Combined with a mechanical heat recover ventilation system to ensure that fresh filtered air circulates the homes and keeping the temperature between 20-22 degrees all year round.</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Taranaki-2-scaled.jpg""><img src=""https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Taranaki-2-1024x485.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-10808"" /></a></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first thing to appreciate when thinking about the different approach required for Passive House design is to recognise that any building can be designed using the Passive House Standard.&nbsp; Essentially the approach is the same whether the building is a home, office, church or apartment block.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The major difference between a conventional and Passive House approach is that from the outset the Passive House has specific targets for the final performance and within the process the tools are there to provide the certainty of attaining these targets. The targets focus on:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Energy consumption</li><li>Internal temperature</li><li>Relative humidity</li><li>Quality of air</li><li>And everything else that goes into creating a space that is perfect for us humans and consuming the minimum amount of energy.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As it turns out when we get this right, the structure of the building is also optimally created ensuring longevity with minimal maintenance. This is in direct contrast to a home that is built to code minimum being likely to require significant maintenance over time, especially related to internal moisture issues that are often present.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Passive House Design Example&nbsp;</strong><br>A good example of this is the home that Professor Wolfgang Fiest the founder of Passive House lives in, this was the first example of a Passive House building, and he moved into the home in 1991. The building is still providing the same comfort and low energy consumption with minimal maintenance 32 years later.&nbsp;<a href=""https://blog.passivehouse-international.org/first-passive-house-wolfgang-feist/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">You can read about it here</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The really clever part of the <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/who-we-are/passive-house-faqs/"">Passive House</a> approach is that any materials can be used as long as when combined they will meet the requirements set in the energy modelling software called the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP). That is why the <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/projects/"">projects</a> that we design and build all look so different.</p>

<p><strong>What are the Passive House Design Key Principles?</strong><br>There are key principles that guide the architecture from the outset. The main one being an efficient form factor i.e., the surface area that is in contact with the outside divided by the useful floor space. This is closely followed by the appropriate amount of glazing and the orientation of both glazing and the building relative to the sun which has a significant impact on both the solar gain and heat loss. There are many other contributing factors, but these are the main considerations that are embraced from the outset for any new Passive House design.</p>

<p>A lot of activity in the construction industry – unprecedented times with New Zealand in a building boom. We are excited to be part of the action, with a record number of eHaus designs and constructions under way across the country. So many conversations around sustainability, carbon emissions and demand and, not being ones to shy away from the hot topics, we have loads to share about our contribution and being part of positive change in these areas.</p>

<p>The topic of Carbon emissions is such a big one. The world still appears to be grappling and is yet to agree why this is an issue, let alone be offering solutions, but the most pressing thing here is speed –&nbsp;just how quickly can we adapt and change our behaviour? The team at eHaus have been doing the maths to find out how we can help. Just how positive is the impact of a high performing energy efficient house on Carbon savings?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Passive House principles are built upon science. With over 30+ years’ of research, it continues to prove over and over, that applying this science to the design and construction of our spaces really does make a difference, not only to carbon emissions but also to our health. With such an achievable alternative to building, it still puzzles us why kiwis still bother to build anything less, yet our building code standard continues and thousands of homes are built this way every year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the past 12 years, eHaus have been building spaces using the Passive House principles, a proven measured performance you can live by.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We wanted to show the impact energy savings make in every eHaus to reduce carbon emissions through energy savings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Introducing our Carbon Piggy</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A real-time energy carbon savings sum which increases every day as they are recalculated. Shown against each of the projects on our website, we also show the accumulated energy carbon savings for every eHaus we have built (as not all our builds show on the website)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We knew that the savings would be good, but had no idea just how good.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We show the savings in kilograms of carbon for each of the builds, but for the accumulated total that figure has got too long, so is showing in tonnes - yes, tonnes. Already we are over one thousand!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is just for energy carbon savings, compared to a standard home, but it demonstrates the incredible immediate impact a change in design and construction makes. New Zealand has some big mountains to climb to reach the carbon emissions targets set, imagine the contribution if all new builds were energy efficient?</p>

<p>We love our ‘we live like” statement – it grounds us in what’s important and keeps our feet to the fire working to ‘live like’ this everyday in our business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A huge focus here at eHaus is around Sustainability. This word means different things to different people, but for us, it's anchored in our 5 Eco Values. These help us to find the right suppliers and partner with them to offer products that provide environmental, social and economic benefits over their whole life cycle. There are so many things to consider when you build, but keeping sustainable thinking at the forefront is what will truly make the difference .</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have partnered with some of the best producers in New Zealand doing great things in this space.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We salute our friends at Bremworth, for returning to pure wool carpet production only and saying goodbye to plastic fibres – a courageous business decision, but one with incredible conviction, thinking beyond today for tomorrow. Did you know that the average Kiwi home with synthetic carpet is similar to having 22,000 plastic bags on the floor? Bremworth get a big tick from us, and their product is something to seriously consider when selecting your carpet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taps, another key element to consider when building. The WELS star rating is a great tool that helps you to see at a glance how much water your tap will use. The more stars, the better the efficiency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What about paint? Our very own Resene, NZ owned and operated since 1946, produce paints with Low VOC (nasty fumes). Another big tick from us! Well done Resene for wanting to be respected as a company that has ethical and sustainable practises.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We also love the partnership we have with Neocrete – another New Zealand owned and operated company who are doing BIG things with concrete (one of the largest contributors to CO2 emissions). NeoCrete D5 green reduces cement by as much as 30%. This has the potential to significantly reduce the carbon content of the concrete industry (8% of worldwide emission). Plus, D5 green makes concrete more durable!</p>

<p>Taking on the eHaus Taupo licence, Mat has hit the ground running and is already into his second eHaus, with another in the design phase at Kinloch. Mat is a Taupo local, married to Caroline and they have two great school-aged kids. He knows the region inside out.<br><br>“Taupo has some big extremes in climate – icy cold in winter followed by long, hot summers. Living in a home that can handle that really makes sense to me and my clients. Building a PassivHaus with eHaus means clients gets an incredible house that saves them up to 90 per cent in heating costs, with an even temperature all year round.” Mat said<br><br>Passionate about quality homes, Mat has a reputation for his attention to detail and quality, which, combined with his fantastic down-to-earth, approachable style, is a winning mix with clients.<br><br>The current building code is too low, Mat believes. “People deserve more and a healthy, high-performing home for their family should be standard.”<br><br>We asked Heather, his current client, to give us some feedback and this is what she had to say:<br>'Mat is an experienced and thoughtful builder who has an outstanding level of communication and service. He's committed to both his clients and building warm, dry and energy-efficient homes. The eHaus approach is not one-size-fits all - it's very much about the climate of the area you're living in. The eHaus directors are fantastic too, and always ready to answer questions - you can tell it's not just a business for them, it's a passion too.</p>

<p>The recent story about Randal and Pam Greenbank in Te Kauwhata was fantastic, about telling their story to go off the grid, rather than pay the $110,000 for a power cable up their 850m long driveway.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This led them to look for an energy efficient option. After talking with friends who had built an eHaus with Warren and the team in Manawatu, they were so impressed that they signed up with Ross and Julie Brown eHaus Waikato licensees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet to face their first winter, and the inland Waikato frosts, Ross said:<br>“It will be just lovely and warm all winter – they will hardly need to turn on the heater. We did have a frost one morning recently; there was white frost everywhere. I went up to see them later, and they said they didn’t even think to turn on the heater.""</p>

<p>Jon is a director of eHaus. He has been involved in designing and building the passive house way for over 10 years now with eHaus.   He shares his experience of living in a passive house.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The comparison of living in an old, cold villa vs a certified passive house</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think my family’s story is typical of many of us here in Aotearoa that have experienced raising families in a cold home; reliant on a wood burner for the main living area and then struggled to heat the rest of the house. This became a huge worry when our babies came along and keeping their rooms warm? We did our best but despite our efforts our first child developed respiratory issues and suffered from asthma because of our cold Villa. There is no question that our homes are linked to our health, and this is even more so when thinking about our more vulnerable young and old. For my family the contrast when we moved to the eHaus was so radical and had such a positive impact on our way of life and of course our son. Basically, the breathing issues that are associated with asthma disappeared, and the inhaler was forgotten about and put away in a drawer.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do you create a healthy living environment?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many contributing factors that create a healthy living environment but the most crucial are the temperature and air quality. This is well documented with the perfect temperature range being between 20 - 25C and a clean dry supply of fresh that is fully exchanged every 3 hours. It is absolutely no coincidence that these are locked in as key deliverables for every eHaus that we design and build.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How does a certified passive house perform?</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have worked with Auckland University to monitor houses that we have built, and the book Positive Energy Home includes performance data from an eHaus.&nbsp; My own home is using a sophisticated monitoring device that captures the Temperature, Relative Humidity, CO2, TVOC, PM2.5, CO, NO2 and Ozone. Here is a snapshot showing you the figures taken on September 10th 2021.</p>

<p>As you can see all the figures are in green and the overall summary is “Air Quality is great. All parameters are within optimal range, enjoy clean air and keep up the good work”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reality is, when living in an eHaus there is no work to do apart from changing the filters on the MHRV once a year, yes it’s that simple!</p>

<p>Every season has its unique flavour, which we welcome with open arms as we say goodbye to the previous one. But for all its beauty and anticipation, Spring can be a tricky time of year, especially for those who suffer from allergies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""252000""}} -->
<p>But there is a solution, and it’s called an eHaus. Every eHaus is fitted with a high grade filtration system that will block particles up to 3 times thinner than a human hair, and remove 98% of any airborne irritants and nasties, including viruses. We can also go one step higher to the ultimate and add a medical grade hepa filter system that is so fine it will remove 99.9% of particulates. You can choose the option and also benefit from the automated filter replacement service that eHaus offers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""252000""}} -->
<p>Having the confidence that you and your family have fresh filtered air 24/7, and allergy sufferers can breathe easy, is definitely something to consider when building your new home.</p>

<p>BRANZ have bought together primary stakeholders to co-design a collective roadmap for evaluating building performance and Jon Iliffe, one of our eHaus directors, had a seat at the table.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""252000""}} -->
<p>BRANZ have recognised the need for all NZ buildings to be warm dry, healthy and zero carbon but there is currently no consistent, integrated New Zealand-based online solution to evaluate whether a design will meet these performance requirements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""252000""}} -->
<p>The aim of this project is to discover how they can work towards creating a web-based, accessible, integrated solution, that draws on existing tools and data (possibly with adaptation). Through surveys and working groups, this project will identify key themes and issues, and develop recommendations for measuring building performance in the future.</p>

<p>This one is definitely not a new kid on the block. Polished plaster has been used as an interior wall finish since ancient times, and made its first comeback with the 'Tuscan' decorating movement of the 90's (which some of us may be trying to forget). But like all comebacks, polished plaster's resurgence comes with a fresh twist, now available in a range of colours and the knowledge of different applications to achieve stunning finishes.</p>

<p>Hello 2022! As we all continue to work through the various challenges we currently face, one of the unexpected positive outcomes of the past three years has been our ability to pivot and adapt. We have learnt that to change and think differently isn’t as hard as we all think, and as a result, we have learnt new ways of doing things and challenged the norm. At eHaus, we have been committed to challenging the norm for over 12 years now and it excites us to see the change even in the past 12 months.</p>

<p>There is no denying that the past month of hot humid weather has been trying, and our kiwi homes are not designed to cope with so much moisture in the air. We recently overheard a conversation on this topic, where it was said “my carpet feels damp” – and it probably was, as all that moisture had to find somewhere to settle.</p>

<p>Living in an eHaus isn’t just all about being warm in the winter, it's the all year-round comfort. This means on the hottest summer days, your home is sitting comfortably at 22-25°. It’s something, as Kiwis, we don’t expect from our code built homes. We've mastered the art of opening all our doors and windows, hoping for some through air to cool us down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""230000""}} -->

<p><strong>“We absolutely love our eHaus, it is just the best place to be living, it’s got a really different feel to it.&nbsp;Can’t fault it for living in it, we moved in in the height of Summer, and yes, we had some really hot days, but we can have doors open or everything closed and the ventilation system keeps it consistently the same temperature. We’re really loving being here”. - Mary</strong></p>

<p>We had a great few days of filming with Asthma New Zealand Healthy Homes documentary team. Scheduled to come out later this year, this team have travelled the length of the country and have dug deep into the reality of the New Zealand housing stock and how it relates to our health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""230000""}} -->
<p>eHaus were identified as being part of the solution moving forward. It's so exciting to be part of the narrative in telling this story, and we can’t wait to see this showcased on NZ Television. Stay tuned for updates.</p>

<p>We know that trying to keep up with the warranties and maintenance care that come with building a new house is quite a mission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""230000""}} -->
<p>So, we have partnered with Gtee, a simple web-based solution that provides homeowners with product warranties &amp; maintenance. Disclosures and product overviews in an easy-to-use cloud based system. The Gtee system keeps a record for the actions taken for the life of the dwelling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""230000""}} -->
<p>It’s a fantastic option to store and access information that relates to certain products used in the construction, plus the required legal maintenance sometimes required to ensure warranties are honoured.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""230000""}} -->
<p>Our teams will also load information like your paint colour schedule – great if you need to touch up and can’t recall the paint name. In addition, we have worked with Gtee to add in the Zehnder mechanical heat recovery ventilation units to the system; storing user manuals and even reminder emails for our eHaus homeowners to check and/or change the filters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""230000""}} -->
<p>We love this smart technology, freeing up storage space and preventing the need to print or keep manuals, and it's one less thing to worry about.</p>

<p>Statement sinks, they're a thing! And when it comes to making a statement in your kitchen, bathroom or laundry, it's hard to look past the appeal of a concrete sink. The form, colour and finishing options available in concrete basins have created a world of possibilities, allowing you to find and create the perfect basin for your home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""230000""}} -->
<p>Another fresh take on an era of days gone by, concrete sinks bring together the structure and form from brutalist architecture and the pop of the mid-century colour palette. Pair these with a nice natural timber finish and brass or metal fixtures, you'll end up with a room that you won't want to leave!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""254000""}} -->
<p>No tissues are needed this Autumn. It's hard to believe, but thanks to the clever built-in Mechanical Heat Recovery units placed in every eHaus, over 98% of irritants and pollutants are removed from the air before they enter your home. The end result being clean fresh filtered air, 24/7. For those who suffer from allergies at this time of the year, that might seem too good to be true - but it’s a fact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""254000""}} -->
<p>At eHaus, we use both G4 and F7 Zehnder filters in our mechanical heat recovery units. F7 for supply - (the fresh air coming in) and G4 for return air (the stale air heading out). Between them, these filters do the brunt of the filtration work to keep the unit running efficiently and delivering the cleanest air.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""254000""}} -->
<p>So, what’s the difference?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""254000""}} -->
<p>The F7 is a high-efficiency multi-pocket, designed to remove very fine dust particles from the air including soot, pollens, mould spores and bacteria. Used in hotels, museums, pharmaceutical, food manufacturing, plants, hospitals and eHaus’.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""254000""}} -->
<p>The G4 is a coarser filter designed to capture pollen, fog and dust particles. However, it will also capture leaves, insects, textile fibres, sand, ash, mist hair and vehicle emissions. As a result of all of this captured by the filter, allergic reactions are decreased.</p>

<p>We know how important it is that people have choice and confidence in the products that make up their homes. At eHaus we feel the same way, and are always seeking out alternative products that align with our own responsibility matrix of key indicators that guide us when partnering with suppliers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""254000""}} -->
<p>SaveBOARD - ticks all of our eco responsibility matrix boxes with Low Carbon Building Materials made from Upcycled packaging made in New Zealand. These are healthy, affordable, high performance, low carbon building materials that make a circular economy an everyday reality.&nbsp;This Hamilton based manufacturing plant take everyday packaging waste upcycle it into high performing building materials.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""254000""}} -->
<p>saveBOARD is the perfect example of the kind of new choices available thanks to this innovative approach to dealing with waste and creating a circular solution for products that are in such high demand ie: wall linings and exterior rigid air barrier. Also, just recently tested and confirmed, the rigid air barrier is suitable for: wigluv tapes - a Siga product used in the construction of making an eHaus weather and air tight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""254000""}} -->
<p>But wait, there’s an eHaus twist to this story. Our very own eHaus Waikato team have been working directly with saveBOARD who have agreed to take all soft plastic waste generated onsite to incorporate in with the shredded tetra Pak when they manufacture saveBOARD. A total win/win with eHaus Waikato managing their onsite waste responsibly reducing the need for landfill. The perfect solution and yet another example of eHaus living its values.</p>

<p><strong>“Eco homes are all about resilience and punching above their weight”</strong><br>We're making the news! The conversation volume about higher performing homes is being turned up. eHaus was recently approach to be part of a feature story which talked about the benefits of building an eco-friendly home and one of our very own eHaus staff, Jon Iliffe, and clients Heather from Taupo, and Lani from Foxton, were asked for their thoughts on the topic. It is so refreshing to see the light being shone on this topic, and encouraging conversations around why a home built the eHaus way is our future.</p>

14276,"Tackling the climate emissions challenge - it's time we made our buildings responsible","<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""230000""}} -->
<p>What were your thoughts this week on the Emissions Reduction Plan and the Climate Commission's announcements and our need for change?  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""230000""}} -->
<p><em>“Aotearoa New Zealand needs to be moving towards a low emissions and climate resilient future.”&nbsp;</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""230000""}} -->
<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but that must be one of the biggest understatements of the year! And what does move towards really mean?&nbsp; In the short term actually not much, with a lot of thinking and research and very little/slow action to date. The trouble with this kind of approach is the short term has the habit of turning into the long term.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""230000""}} -->
<p>As an&nbsp;example, it was&nbsp;June 23, 1988, when the US announced global warming publicly&nbsp;as an issue that needed action, …. that was 34 years ago! But today the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere is still on the increase!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""230000""}} -->
<p>A critical message at eHaus we are keen to tell, is that solutions to the way we build our homes that make an immediate and real difference to climate change, are already happening here in NZ. A solution developed in the 1990s that has become the normal build standard across numerous countries, many with similar climates as our own. It’s called <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/who-we-are/passive-house-faqs/"">Passive House.</a> A set of scientifically proven principles applied to the design and construction of a home which provides a standard of performance that accurately delivers a space that is healthy, comfortable and energy efficient.</p>

</div></figure>
<!-- /wp:embed -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""230000""}} -->
<p>Just how energy efficient? For the past 12 years our <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/projects/"">eHaus owners</a> have saved on average 86% on active heating or put another way on average only needing 14% of energy to heat their home - when compared to a typical new code-built home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""230000""}} -->
<p>We can say this with certainty because all <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/my-ehaus/"">eHaus’ </a>are energy modelled before they are built. This report not only tells us the energy requirements of the home but also enables us to make any changes to the plans to ensure the home meets the performance standard set.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""230000""}} -->
<p>Knowing our homes energy requirements and performance while still on the plans just isn’t part of our New Zealand psyche. Until now we have believed and trusted that the current minimum build code standard set for our new builds will be comfortable, healthy and efficient. Sadly, so many are disappointed within months of moving in their new home. Experiencing mouldy bathrooms and crying windows, significant energy bills and often many of the rooms not lived in for months of the year as they are either too cold or too hot to enjoy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""230000""}} -->
<p>It’s the way it’s always been, and sure the light has been shone on areas like the need for increased insulation and an extractor fan in the bathroom now mandatory, but it’s just not enough. Since 1990 more than 700,000 homes have been built in New Zealand, the majority to our code minimum standard. Image if energy efficient design and construction principles had been implemented across all these homes? The energy savings alone would be impressive, but that’s just part of the positive impact. The health benefits of families living in a comfortable home all year round would also be huge!&nbsp; And if those homes had been built with the same approach that eHaus uses we would have saved approximately 93 million tonnes of carbon this past 34 years!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""230000""}} -->
<p>But instead, we continue to skirt around the edges of this topic for fear of major disruption to the building industry.&nbsp; The model we have operated for code minimum spaces is desperately in need of an overhaul, and until we shine the light brightly on these standards, we will continue to get the same results. Poor housing stock that continues to add to the seriously damaging carbon issue and families that live in cold damp houses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""230000""}} -->
<p>At eHaus we know that what we do works. We have the research and science behind the standards for performance that we target. The energy efficiencies, the healthy comfortable spaces don’t need to be just for the few that know about them.&nbsp; There is an alternative happening right now, right here in NZ.</p>

<p><strong>It’s time we made our buildings responsible</strong> and provided a positive contribution towards lowering our carbon emissions.&nbsp; The carbon savings made with any high performing home are immediate. We also measure the carbon savings of our eHaus’ and document this <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/who-we-are/carbon-savings/"">live on our website daily</a>. Today 1301 tonnes have been avoided entering our environment, and we credit this through the energy efficiencies of our homes.<br><br>Here’s the challenge New Zealand?&nbsp; Let’s move the emissions pendulum back to where it needs to be and step into our responsibility by challenging the way we build our homes.&nbsp; Embrace the knowledge of what is already proven and start the change by choosing to build high performing healthy homes that save the planet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This eHaus was able to achieve an air tightness rating of 0.53 ACHn50 (the measure of the air exchange through the building envelope under a 50Pa pressure difference). A new code-built house will typically test between 3-5 ACHn50 and a Villa 25-30 ACHn50.</p>

<p>The window system delivered a solution with considerably greater performance than the current building standard of R0.26. This eHaus has an R value rating in the vicinity of R0.50.&nbsp; With the pending Building Code changes increasing the R value rating to R0.37 in November 2022 and a further increase to R0.46 in November 2023, this project is proof that it is both theoretically and practically possible to achieve and exceed the future residential building standards using New Zealand made, high performing aluminium window products.</p>

<p>The thermal performance of the window system has resulted in a home which is highly efficient to heat and cool. Using the Passive House energy modelling tool, this home has been designed to require 85% less heating than a new code-built house, with annual energy consumption forecast at 16.4kWh/m2 of floor area compared with an average new code-built home that would require 120kWh/m2 of floor area. This is to maintain a minimum temperature of 20C all year round.</p>

<p>The bite of Winter is finally here, but for those who live in and love their eHaus, there is no obvious change in season. The same consistent even temperature means the usual challenges of keeping warm are no longer top of mind. We wish everyone had an eHaus and was able to enjoy Winter for its beauty, rather an its bite.</p>

<p>Our fantastic clients Andrew and Lucinda Searle and their <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/project/taranaki-egmont-village/"">award winning eHaus</a> was featured in Stuff recently, by journalist Colleen Hawkes. It’s so exciting for any business when mainstream media picks up your story and writes about it, so naturally we were stoked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>This home is a super star in so many ways. A Certified Passive House Classic, 2021 Masterbuilder Top 100, Gold and Regional Category award winner. The story of a progressive, forward-thinking young family of five who wanted more from their new build.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>“We were keen on building a better-quality house, rather than a bigger house,” Andrew Searle says. “I think a lot of people can fall into the trap of ‘how big is your home’, but actually, asking how your house performs is a better question.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>It’s something we observe at eHaus, with others building to code, where the question of performance isn’t part of the conversation. We believe it really matters, so much so, that we energy model every one of our homes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>The Searles joke that they haven’t set their children up well if they want to go to Otago and live in university flats when they are older, because their house is just so comfortable to live in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>Hofmans Builders won a Registered Master Builders House of the Year Award last year for the project. The house was the Taranaki Regional Category winner in the $600,000 to $750,000 category, and a gold winner.</p>

<p>This is the first time we have entered the WGANZ awards, in partnership with Wight Aluminium, and our beautiful Watson family home took out first place for the Sustainability Award.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>Simon Penn, our eHaus Whanganui District licensee, and his team worked closely with Wight Aluminium through manufacturing, construction, and installation stages to achieve the airtightness objectives for this home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>Joinery and glazing are traditionally where huge amounts of heat loss occur. The window and door products for this home were purposefully chosen to reduce these losses. This included the selection of French doors that provide better airtightness over other sliding door available.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->

<h3 class=""has-text-align-center"">“... It was designed and built-in accordance with Passive House principles and these, naturally enough, have given it a very high degree of thermal and acoustic performance. The health benefits of Passive House are well known, and this house delivers them too. <strong>In many ways this project represents many of the features that should necessarily become commonplace in residential construction in Aotearoa New Zealand in the future.</strong> The technologies to improve thermal performance and save energy are now well known. This house is therefore an exemplar project and as such it deserves commendation”</h3>

<p>The collaboration with Wight Aluminium, along with the excellence in construction, paid off with the home achieving an air tightness rating of 0.53 ACHn50.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>What is ACHn50? - This is a measure of how many&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>ir&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>hanges per&nbsp;<strong>H</strong>our the entire volume of air within a house is exchanged at a pressure of 50 Pascals (50 Pascals are the international standard of measure for this type of testing). To give some perspective a typical new code-built home would rate&nbsp;<strong>3 – 5&nbsp;</strong>ACHn50 and a&nbsp;<strong>Typical Villa 25 – 30&nbsp;</strong>ACHn50 The lower the number, the better the air tightness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>The home features thermally broken double glazed low-E Argon filled joinery throughout and high performing and larger-than-standard glass edge spacers.</p>

<p>We pride ourselves in energy modelling every eHaus using the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP). We know this sets us apart in the building industry, but some might ask – why bother, and how does it work?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>If we compare buying a car with building a new home, there are a similar set of questions we might ask ourselves before we purchase, like: How much will it cost? How many kilometres per litre will I get? What are the safety features of this vehicle? How do I know the information about this vehicle is valid? The answer to these questions hugely influences whether we progress with the purchase or not. Yet when we build a new home, (probably the most significant financial expense in our lifetime) many don’t stop to ask similar questions like: How much energy will this house cost to keep us comfortable? Will my family be safe and healthy living in this home? How do I know the information about my home’s performance is valid?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>The PHPP is a very smart piece of software developed by Dr Wolfgang Fiest &amp; Darmstadt University in Germany. It energy models how your house is going to perform giving you the answers to your questions up front. It provides extremely accurate information giving you the confidence to proceed from the start, along with being able to make changes while still on the plans to ensure you get the performance standard you are after.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3,""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<h3>So, how does it work?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>A specialist team work through the process early in the design phase to understand how the house will perform in its unique climate and surroundings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>This is done by creating a scale model of the home in the design PH software and setting this into the local 3D terrain by importing a snapshot from Google Earth. All of the local features that will have an impact on the performance, like trees and surrounding buildings, are then added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>Once this base model is created, a range of window and door configurations are tested to find the right balance between performance, functionality, daylighting and aesthetic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>This information is shared via a detailed report with the designer, builder and homeowner, giving the team the ability to make informed decisions and adjustments, and the confidence to look forward to a home that is warm, comfortable and energy efficient. It’s pretty cool stuff.</p>

<p>We got thinking, and realised that it would be great to clearly demonstrate the predicated heat savings the PHPP report generates for each of our homes. So we have developed a badge which shows the percentage of heat energy savings for each of our projects on the website. Through this exercise we were easily able to calculate the average predicated heat savings (when compared to a similar code-built house in the same region) for all our builds. The results are impressive, coming in at 86% - now that’s something to shout about!

<p>A large and unprecedented new alliance of business, health, sustainability, environmental, consumer, building and housing organisations are today calling on all political parties to prioritise a ‘pollution busting home reno programme’ for hundreds of thousands of homes if elected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>eHaus has joined forces with Consumer NZ, the Asthma and Respiratory Foundation, Greenpeace Aotearoa, the Sustainable Business Network, Lawyers for Climate Action, the New Zealand Institute of Building, Bayleys, Vector, JLL, Bunnings, Architectural Designers New Zealand, Sustainability Trust, Community Housing Aotearoa, the Insulation Association of New Zealand, Knauf Insulation, Beca, Community Energy Network, Passive House Institute New Zealand, SuperHome Movement, eHaus, Inzide, Architectus, Professor Robyn Phipps, and the Green Building Council, to ask political parties to promise a ‘fully funded ambitious’ roll out to improve at least 200,000 homes.</p>

<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>In a joint statement, the groups say:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>“<em>We’re calling on every political party to promise now that, if part of the next government, they will have within six months of being elected a fully funded ambitious plan to roll out a pollution busting home reno programme for at least 200,000 homes within nine years, which will slash carbon emissions and household bills, and improve the health of thousands of New Zealanders, young and old, and create tens of thousands of jobs.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>The most recent census discovered that&nbsp;over 300,000 homes<a id=""_ftnref1"" href=""#_ftn1"">[1]</a>&nbsp;in New Zealand were always or sometimes damp, more than 250,000 homes had visible mould larger than A4 size at least some of the time, and that Māori and Pacific peoples were more likely to live in homes affected by dampness or mould than other ethnic groups. Over two in five Māori and Pacific peoples lived in damp housing.<br><br>Ambitiously renovating New Zealand homes would make a fully renewable, fossil fuel free electricity system easier and cheaper to achieve by dramatically reducing electricity demand for heating – while also helping to alleviate the so-called ‘dry year problem’, recent&nbsp;research<a id=""_ftnref2"" href=""#_ftn2"">[2]</a>&nbsp;has found.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>Housing is the second most important voting issue for New Zealanders, according to&nbsp;polling by Curia Market Research<a id=""_ftnref3"" href=""#_ftn3"">[3]</a>.<br><br>The Green Building Council’s chief executive Andrew Eagles said: “This is a large and formidable alliance of organisations, and the breadth of issues that they cover shows the staggeringly wide level of concern at the sorry state of homes in Aotearoa.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>“These influential and diverse voices are now asking all political parties for solid action to improve hundreds of thousands of homes. Doing so would have huge benefits for New Zealanders – cutting household bills, improving health, slashing carbon pollution, and creating thousands of jobs, helping a just transition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>“This is just the beginning. We’re asking all organisations who want better homes for everyone in Aotearoa to add their voice to this growing coalition by going to <a href=""https://thehomeswedeserve.org.nz/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thehomeswedeserve.org.nz</a>.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>Jon Iliffe of eHaus said: “There has never been a better time than now to future-proof against fuel poverty by lowering the amount of energy required in our homes to stay healthy. There is no question that this is one of the best investments we can make for the benefit of all.”</p>

Basically, asking the question, is an MHRV a good thing? The simple answer is yes, and a recent specific study in the UK and Europe adds a bit more as to the reasons why. A passive house’s mechanical ventilation heat recovery (MVHR) system should help reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission: it’s like having windows open all the time but with no draughts and no significant heat loss.</p>
Covid-19 mostly spreads where people are close to each other, especially in poorly ventilated indoor spaces. The UK government, <a style=""color: #8ebf3f; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline;"" href=""https://youtu.be/qYZMOG2kUWg"">which has just released a video</a> about this, saying that a fresh air supply to a room reduces the Covid-19 risk by over 70%.

The Federation of European Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Associations (REHVA) has recently updated its advice. It states that when <a style=""color: #8ebf3f; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline;"" href=""https://www.rehva.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/REHVA_COVID-19_guidance_document_V3_03082020.pdf"">a ventilation system is on it can reduce the concentration of virus-containing particles</a> breathed out by an infected person. A Passivhaus MVHR system is on all the time and provides a continuous supply of 100% fresh air throughout the house.

By the way, if you need replacement filters for your Zehender MHRV system we stock them here at <a style=""color: #8ebf3f; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline;"" href=""https://www.5merchants.co.nz"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">5Merchants</a> or join our filter replacement service by emailing <a style=""color: #8ebf3f; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline;"" href=""mailto:admin@ehaus.co.nz"">admin@ehaus.co.nz</a></td>

Recent tours over one weekend have been seeing 5,000 visits to the homes. With covid interrupting everyone’s lives, there were still 1,000 visits to the 2021 Superhome tour over two days.</p>
This tells us there is a growing interest in ‘what really is a healthy home?’ How does that impact on us, our family, our environment and our country? In the immediate future, we will see more changes in our industry and more discussions at government level about how we are building here in NZ, resulting in changes that will see us building more effectively and responsibly.

The upgrades to the H1 section of the building code will be implemented by 1 May this year. Some of the new requirements are insulation in floors, more insulation in the roof along with the use of thermally broken aluminium joinery as a minimum. We are excited to see this significant step in the right direction and are expectant that in a few more years the building science principles that we adopted back in 2010 will become the norm for everyone.

With 30-degree heat that we experience, it can be hard to keep cool unless we have unlimited access to a pool. In eHaus homes, it not only stays a constant temperature in winter, but also in summer, as the temperature is controlled to keep the home nice and cool (relative to the outside temperature). Modelling the home to keep it cool in summer is just as important as keeping it warm in winter. We talk about this in The Gist, watch via the button below!</p>

<p>New Zealand’s passive house design and building innovator eHaus is continuing their ongoing support of Kiwis with respiratory conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>eHaus has re-signed as a Silver Sponsor in the <a href=""https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Asthma and Respiratory Foundation’s</a> Friends of the Foundation programme.  “eHaus was the first company to join us when the Friends of the Foundation programme launched in 2020.  They shared our vision for improving the respiratory health of all New Zealanders and have been loyal supporters of our work since then,” says Foundation Chief Executive Letitia Harding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>Ms Harding explains that long-term partnerships with like-minded companies like eHaus are essential to the Foundation.&nbsp; “We receive no Government funding, so we are reliant on the generosity of individuals and business who understand the value of good respiratory health and are committed to making a difference in this area.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>eHaus National Marketing Manager Sarah Carson says eHaus has long understood the link between a healthy home and good respiratory health.&nbsp; “Living in a warm and dry environment is good for everyone, but for people with a respiratory condition it is vital for them to stay well.&nbsp; Constructing the healthiest, energy-efficient homes is our goal, and the work the Asthma and Respiratory Foundation does, is a perfect fit for eHaus.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""240000""}} -->
<p>Respiratory health continues to be a significant issue for New Zealand: respiratory conditions are the third most common cause of death for Kiwis and cause one in every 11 hospitalisations.&nbsp; Ms Harding explains: “Changing these statistics is the Foundation’s priority, but we can only achieve this through a broad, collective effort.&nbsp; We are so grateful to eHaus for stepping up and being part of this work.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nestled in one of Whanganui's most sought-after areas, the Tasman Estate subdivision by Sustainabuilt Developments, offers a unique building opportunity. Conveniently located close to the CBD yet surrounded by countryside, Tasman Estate balances convenience with rural tranquility.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 42 sections vary from 396 - 2,751sqm and have been designed to make the most of the breathtaking views and the environment. Some sections have both sea and city views, while others overlook surrounding farmland.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each section has town water, sewerage, stormwater, power and gas, and fibre telecommunications services, and are protected with covenants to maintain the quality of the neighbourhood and protect your investment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With section prices ranging from $283,000 - $377,000, Tasman Estate provides a variety of options to suit your preferences. Unlike most subdivisions, retaining walls have been completed to flatten and tier the sections, maximising useable space and views.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sustainabuilt Developments have partnered with Simon Penn Building and eHaus Whanganui to build healthy, comfy, and high performing homes in Tasman Estate. With years of experience in constructing high performing and passive homes, we bring unmatched expertise and a strong commitment to quality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Setting your home up to deliver comfort and efficiency is easier than you might think, both in terms of cost and design. When it comes to building your home, we work within your budget and provide two flexible design options:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>1. Build-ready plans: Choose from a range of existing plans, each embodying clever design. With pricing starting from $550,000, you can feel at ease knowing these plans are ready to go.</li><li>2. Custom design: Start with a blank canvas and collaborate with our design team to create a bespoke home, unique for you. </li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With several homes completed and others in construction, now is the perfect time to secure your future at Tasman Estate. Trust eHaus Whanganui and Simon Penn Building to bring your dream home to life. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""252000""}} -->
<p>fortyone ARCHITECTURE is a boutique architectural studio obsessed with bespoke residential architecture led by Nick Harrison. Part of the eHaus designhaus team, Nick specialises in Passive House design.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""252000""}} -->
<p><strong>What’s your background and the story of fortyone ARCHITECTURE?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""252000""}} -->
<p>I always wanted to start my own business, but how we were living before wasn't how we wanted to live, so we moved to a small town, we lowered our expenses, we started our own business. We’ve still got young kids, a 6-year-old and a three-year old, so I want to be around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""252000""}} -->
<p>We've got a remote team and everybody's in the same position as us. We have young families. We want to experience life rather than just disappearing into an office.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""252000""}} -->
<p>So that's what we've created.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""252000""}} -->
<p>To summarise, it was started to create the life that I wanted and attract people that want the same sort of life. And the intention with initiating being a part of the designHaus was the same thing. We want to be to be ahead of the curve and be part of a wider team. It’s exciting for us to be a part of the designHaus.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""252000""}} -->
<p><strong>Why do you think the eHaus approach to design and construction is important?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""252000""}} -->
<p>Design wise, just spending the time upfront before you do any construction, so that might seem like an obvious thing, but in terms of how the home's going to perform, that's not really considered in other ways of going about the process. So that's a big advantage that clients can expect with eHaus. And I think that advantage is massive, it’s around thinking long term, ensuring that you are getting what you're intending to, and you know our process allows for that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""252000""}} -->
<p>It seems so obvious when you talk about it now, but that’s not how the rest of the industry operates.</p>

<p><strong>What are your top tips for people preparing to build their new home?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""dynamicAttributes"":{""toolsetDSVersion"":""252000""}} -->
<p>With the long-term nature of such a big investment, let's put in the effort. Let's have something you're proud of long term and that also looks like an awesome house. So, we obviously want it to perform well and that's the intention when we start. But we still want to appreciate a nice home when we're living in it, so that's very important for clients to understand that we can achieve that. That is what we are good at. We're good at making things look great and perform well.</p>

<p>Asthma New Zealand presents Healthy Homes – A Kiwi Dream. A series of six episodes which showcase how homes are built and what can be done to make homes healthier which, in turn, keeps the people that live within them healthier.</p>

<p><strong>Episode 1</strong></p>

<p>Katheren, Chief Executive of Asthma New Zealand speaks to a variety of experts about the problem with our homes in New Zealand. Watch the video below to learn more.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this episode Katheren speaks to a Building Enclosure Engineer, who talks a walk through a typical kiwi home to identify what can be done to improve the health of this home. The homeowners who suffer from Asthma discover what they need to do to make their home healthy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr Nevil Pierse, Associate Professor, Deputy Director He Kāinga Ora, talks about the effects of unhealthy homes being linked to children’s diseases and ill health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A staggering 28,000 children are hospitalised each year in New Zealand due to housing related diseases. It’s the same kids again and again, if you’re hospitalised due to a housing related disease, you’re 3.5 times more likely to go back to hospital again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A house built today to the NZ building code in NZ, would not pass the Irish building code from when Dr Nevil Pierse was born.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr Pierse suggest that rather than try to find medical cures to the bad housing, let’s fix the housing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Professor Philipa Howden-Chapman, Programme Director He Kāinga Ora is asked what she thinks would have the biggest impact on immediate change and her response is changes to the building code. We’ve been promised that we’re going to get a new building code, it’s been over 10 years since it’s been updated. It’s well below most countries in the OCD. We know from other countries such as Germany and Ireland, the things that are important. We need a new building code.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chelydra Percy, CEO, BRANZ talks to Katheren about her experience of renovating her own home from damp, cold and unhealthy to a warm, dry, healthy home. How living in an unhealthy home impacted her family’s health and the improvement since the renovations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>David Kelly, Chief Executive, Registered Master Builders Association talks about the review of the building code and the need for continuous improvement. He also discusses how the building sector needs to work better together to improve the health of our homes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>John Sneyd, General Manager Building System Performance MBIE, talks about the review of the building code and their commitment to improving it.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization’s data shows, if you live in a mild climate, you’re more likely to die in winter. If you don’t build well, it’s uncomfortable, cold, damp, mouldy, there is respiratory illness, but that doesn’t kill us tonight, it’s a slow burn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Housing is the first line of defence in providing health, if we spent some more money in the housing sector, we’d have less demand on the health care system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Insulation is just one component of making a house warmer. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Protecting insulation from the outside and the inside, with layers – airtightness and vapour control layers is really important.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The eHaus difference</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every eHaus is built with the right amount of insulation to match the regional climate. They also have fully insulated slabs, to keep the heat in. But that’s not enough on its own. eHaus’ are built air-tight to stop air escaping, so there are no cold draughts. They have a mechanical heat recovery ventilation system which circulate fresh air and extract excess moisture in the air. The building envelope is built to stay warm and comfortable, with no moisture or mould, resulting in an extremely healthy living environment.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4><strong>Episode 3</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this episode, Katheren, Chief Executive of Asthma New Zealand focuses on what ventilation looks like and how we can use it to keep our internal environment healthy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:embed {""url"":""https://youtu.be/4eJB2o0E_r8"",""type"":""video"",""providerNameSlug"":""youtube"",""responsive"":true,""className"":""wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio""} -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5><strong>Moisture in homes</strong></h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On average, we generate 10 Litres of moisture every day in our homes from cooking, showering, breathing and drying clothes indoors. That moisture is in our homes and if it doesn’t go anywhere, it condenses allowing mould to grow. Mould gives off tiny spores that can go into our respiratory system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5><strong>What causes crying windows?</strong></h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Condensation on the windows has to do with the relative humidity in the air inside the room, when the air hits a surface that is too cold, like glass for instance, it condenses as it can’t hold that moisture. So, the warm air that we’ve used to heat up the room, find its way to a cold surface, the cold surface can’t hold the moisture, so it condenses. That water evaporates from the windows, into the fabric of that room (into bedding, curtains, walls). If moisture persists, mould will grow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5><strong>Using ventilation to manage condensation</strong></h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ventilation are the lungs of our house, but opening windows isn’t enough.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A ventilation system is an effective way of controlling moisture in homes. It controls the amount of air that is changed within the home, it takes air from the outside into the house, and takes air from the inside, out of the house. Balancing out the flow in a controlled way. With it, you can get rid of the pollutants in the home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5><strong>The eHaus difference</strong></h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We know the importance of ventilation here at eHaus. Every eHaus is built with a Mechanical Heat Recovery Ventilation system which works effectively in the background, so you can breathe fresh air and stay warm while using less energy. Our homes have fresh filtered air, with up to 99% of pollutants removed. Meaning no moisture or mould will occur in an eHaus.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In November 2021, the New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment (MBIE) initiated a transformative shift in energy efficiency by unveiling substantial updates to the Building Code, specifically in the H1 category. These changes mark one of the most significant leaps in energy efficiency standards in over a decade. The primary goal? To create warmer, drier, and healthier buildings that not only cost significantly less to heat but also generate substantial carbon savings through improved energy efficiency. Here we take a closer look at the key amendments to the NZ Building Code H1, highlighting why going beyond the minimum standard is an investment in a brighter, more sustainable future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The journey toward enhanced energy efficiency began on 29 November 2021 when MBIE introduced a series of amendments to the Building Code H1. It wasn't just an incremental step; it was a leap forward, designed to align New Zealand's building standards with a more sustainable and energy-efficient future. The transition kicked off with the first tranche of changes on 3 November 2022, followed by the second on 1 May 2023. The final and third tranche is slated for 2 November 2023. So, what are these changes that are reshaping the way we build and live?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>1. Climate zones: From three to six</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most pivotal alterations was the expansion of New Zealand's climate zones. Formerly divided into three regions, the revised Building Code now recognizes six distinct climate zones. This expansion acknowledges the diverse climate conditions across the nation and tailors’ energy efficiency requirements to suit each unique environment. The increased granularity allows for more precise and effective energy solutions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>2. Insulation requirements: A comprehensive overhaul</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The changes introduced a comprehensive upgrade to insulation requirements for various building components, including roofs, walls, floors, windows, doors, and skylights. These enhanced insulation standards are a significant stride toward creating buildings that are not just energy-efficient but also comfortable and sustainable. A well-insulated building retains heat in winter and keeps it out in summer, promoting year-round comfort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>3. HVAC compliance pathway for commercial buildings</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a notable development, the revised Building Code now provides a new compliance pathway for Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in commercial buildings. This pathway aligns with the overarching goal of reducing energy consumption in commercial spaces, further contributing to energy efficiency and sustainability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3><strong>The evident benefits of building beyond the minimum code</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Building Code sets the <em>minimum</em> standard for construction in New Zealand. It's the foundation upon which builders, developers, and homeowners build. However, the question arises: why stop at the minimum when you can aim higher? Building beyond the minimum standard, as eHaus has consistently demonstrated, offers a multitude of benefits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>1. Lower energy costs</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By investing upfront in building a higher standard envelope for your home, you significantly reduce the ongoing energy costs required to maintain a comfortable environment. It's a simple equation: higher performance equals lower ongoing energy expenses. This financial benefit is not only immediate but continues to pay dividends for the entire life of the home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>2. Immediate comfort and health</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Homes constructed to higher standards are not only more energy-efficient but also provide occupants with immediate comfort and health benefits. From day one, residents enjoy warmth, comfort, and better overall well-being.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>3. A more sustainable future</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Building beyond the minimum standard contributes to a more sustainable future. It reduces the carbon footprint of homes, making a meaningful impact on our environment and advancing the cause of sustainability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>eHaus: Pioneers in energy efficiency</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since 2010, eHaus has consistently set the benchmark for energy-efficient home construction and has always significantly surpassed the minimum standard. These changes signify that the rest of the country is now realising the importance of energy efficiency. Our commitment to energy efficiency, sustainability, and the well-being of occupants is unwavering. While it is a step in the right direction, the new standards still have no comfort and performance requirements which is at the heart of every eHaus.&nbsp;We understand that investing upfront in high-performance building is an investment in a brighter, more sustainable future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The changes to the NZ Building Code H1 are not just about improving standards; they're about improving lives and our environment.

<h2><strong>Pioneering the future of energy-efficient and sustainable living with first Certified Passive House in Waitaki</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We are proud to announce the completion of the first certified passive house in the Waitaki region, setting new standards for energy efficiency, comfort, and healthy living. This groundbreaking project not only showcases the innovative solutions provided by eHaus but also highlights the dedication of its owners in embracing a sustainable vision for their home. Their story recently featured in an <a href=""https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/homed/sustainable-living/133373376/young-couples-first-home-is-a-certified-passive-house-in-oamaru"">article by Stuff</a>, and the level of interest has been incredible.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Passive House is an internationally recognised performance-based building standard that delivers a building that requires very little energy for heating or cooling. The result is a home that provides a warm and comfortable living environment. The temperature is even throughout the home and operates typically between 20 and 25 degrees, while consuming minimal energy. Passive House<br>certification is only awarded to buildings that meet the rigorous energy efficiency and comfort standards set by the Passive House Institute.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Meet the young visionaries behind this remarkable project – Sam and Ashleigh. Sam learned about passive house not long after leaving high school, and as an Engineer with a technical mind, thought it was a ‘neat concept’. When he and Ashleigh met in Oamaru a short time later, he introduced her to the idea and after joining an eHaus webinar, their journey for sustainable living began. It was their passion and the dedication of the eHaus Waitaki team that resulted in the first certified passive house being built in Waitaki.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This home proudly adheres to the eHaus Euro performance standard, delivering an impressive 91% predicted heat energy savings. This achievement not only reflects the commitment of Sam and Ashleigh to sustainability but also underscores eHaus' expertise in constructing homes that prioritise energy efficiency, health, and comfort.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>As we eagerly anticipate Kevin McCloud's speaking tour in February 2024, his recent interview with RNZ's Jim Mora has already left a mark on our perspective of housing in New Zealand and the UK. </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In McCloud's reflections, two crucial points stood out, aligning seamlessly with eHaus' commitment to redefining the way we live.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McCloud's first insight dissected the prevailing trend of constructing homes merely to meet minimal standards. He shed light on the mindset behind this, contrasting it with the commendable efforts of developers, housing associations, councils, and builders who prioritise top-tier construction. Despite claims that building to higher standards incurs excessive costs, McCloud showcased instances where entities successfully delivered high-performance, energy-efficient homes. These projects, though slightly higher in cost (around 10-15% more), underscore the feasibility of creating dwellings that offer ongoing exceptional performance and the ultimate living experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second gem from McCloud focused on the concept of happiness in housing design, criticising the phenomenon of sprawling suburban 'McMansions' with excessive features like numerous bathrooms. Instead, he championed the Swedish idea of 'Lagom,' meaning 'just the right amount.' This philosophy advocates for homes that aren't excessively large but perfectly sized, avoiding unnecessary extravagance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The aha moment for us was realising that by combining these insights—high-performance homes embracing the 'just enough' ethos—the costs are comparable or even less than a mansion built to the minimum standard. Reflecting on the nearly-200 Kiwis who have chosen to build an eHaus, this approach rings true. Our homes, optimised in size and meticulously designed for efficiency, stand in stark contrast to the inflated costs associated with oversized, standard-built houses. This amalgamation of superior quality and conscientious size could revolutionise the cost dynamics of housing, presenting an intriguing alternative to conventional construction practices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At eHaus, we've always believed in offering more than just homes; we provide a lifestyle that prioritises comfort, health, and energy efficiency. As we continue to redefine the way we live, Kevin McCloud's insights resonate profoundly with our mission.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone is well aware that the NZ building industry has been through a few interesting years and here at eHaus we are starting 2024 with confidence and zest following the recent release of new industry research and data.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3><strong>A recent history of the NZ building industry</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coming out of Covid, 2021 saw the continuation of the lowest ever NZ mortgage rates and a record year in residential building consents, and with it a shortage of key materials. Prices of timber, steel, board products, roofing materials, paint and even nails increased drastically nationwide. Small orders were cancelled to prioritise major clients and some work sites came to a grinding standstill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2022 saw housing consents reach a monthly record in March and mortgage rates start to increase throughout the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2023 the building industry experienced a quick shift. Demand for new builds slowed, annual housing consents dropped for the first time since records began in 2014, and construction companies made up 29% of all business liquidations in January and February that year. It was a tough one!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through those challenging years, eHaus remained steadfast, ensuring quality and performance even during those material shortages. You can read more about that in the <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/my-ehaus/ehaus-euro/#TheJettyHouse"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Jetty House article</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3><strong>2024, another year of change</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just as quickly as things turned tough, the good news is that the building industry is changing again. We are starting 2024 with confidence and zest following the recent release of new industry research and data. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Here's why we think 2024 is a great year to build a new home:</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Prices for building materials have stabilised and, in some instances, dropped slightly. For consumers, this means committing to a new build has less risk and more price certainty than it did in 2021 when material prices were unpredictable.</li><li>Housing consents have dropped from the peak of 5,303 in March 2022 to 2,958 in November 2023. This means there is currently less pressure on the building industry for supply of materials, and builders’ workload is back to a manageable level. Gone are the long 6-12 month wait lists and consumers can now get their work started in a more realistic timeframe. As building projects and consents begin to increase, its inevitable builders and suppliers will become swamped again as we move toward another boom.</li><li>The latest Cordell Construction Cost Index has highlighted both of these points as well, stating “On balance, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the annual rate of change in the CCCI run at 3-4% over 2024, with builders still busy, but not facing the intense pressure of recent years. In other words, for households potentially looking to buy a new-build or commission their own project, it’s unlikely to get any cheaper. But at least the cost won’t be spiking higher either.”</li><li>In <a href=""https://thespinoff.co.nz/the-bulletin/15-01-2024/a-brighter-tomorrow-the-nz-economic-outlook-for-2024"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">her article</a> on 15 January, writer Catherine McGregor discusses the UN’s World Economic Situation and Prospects report and economic outlook for 2024. “The UN report forecasts NZ will end 2024 with inflation at 3.4%, then drop to 2.6% in 2025. That’s less optimistic than Treasury, which is forecasting inflation back within the Reserve Bank’s target 1-3% range by the end of this year. As inflation drops, so too should we see falls in interest rates.” writes Catherine. Also in the article, David Cunningham of mortgage brokers Squirrel says “I would be surprised if we don’t see most fixed interest rates down between 0.5% and 1% by March.”</li><li>Election years are anecdotally slower in many industries, and the building industry has been no exception. Consumers tend to become more cautious with their spending in the lead up to elections. A new government brings steadiness and with it, a more positive mood for the building industry. In the months since the new government was formed, we have seen our enquiries pick up again, which is confirmation that things are heading in the right direction.</li><li>The CoreLogic House Price Index released on 17 January shows a third consecutive rise in average property values in December, and while CoreLogic NZ Chief Property Economist, Kelvin Davidson says 2024 will still have some ‘patchiness’, to us it is a sign that the market is shifting again. ""A further rise in property values in December seemed almost inevitable given housing market sentiment has risen in recent months. This is off the back of several factors including the change of government, a peak - and even some falls - in mortgage rates, continued growth in employment, and soaring net migration,"" Mr Davidson said.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, we see 2024 being a great year to build an eHaus. Building prices have stabilised providing more price certainty, mortgage rates have reached their peak and are expected to fall, and builders are not facing such intense workloads.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone is well aware that the NZ building industry has been through a few interesting years. Coming out of Covid in 2021 saw a huge shift, mostly caused by the lowest mortgage rates ever seen in NZ and a building boom, followed by material prices increasing and product shortages. It was a turbulent time, but just as quickly as things turned tough, the good news is that the building industry is changing again.</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CASE-STUDY-3.jpg""><img src=""https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CASE-STUDY-3-1024x460.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-16363"" /></a></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every summer we want to open windows and doors to encourage air flow through the house - if we’re lucky on those hot, humid days to get a breeze. But without adequate shade, the sun and heat continues to pour in, and a breath of wind often brings allergens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In winter, we heat our houses (and pay to do so) yet 40 per cent of the heat can quickly disappear out the windows. Closing your curtains early in the evening helps keep in some heat as the sun goes down.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Heating in Kiwi homes is often in living spaces, rather than bedrooms or hallways, so these areas stay cold with temperatures often falling below 18 degrees. The World Health Organisation says for comfortable sleeping, bedrooms should be between 18 and 22 degrees (or a minimum of 20 degrees for houses with young children, elderly or ill people).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another important aspect is what is going on behind the walls. Mould affects our health and unfortunately finds itself any comfortable space to grow with consistently cold temperatures.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The solution to any of these issues in a home is an efficient ventilation system along with adequate insulation, high performing windows, and shading.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some might think having a house with a ventilation system is not warranted: it’s an extra expense. Why not continue to open windows and doors on a hot day, or put on a jumper when it’s cold?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thankfully we have come a long way since that kind of thinking. We can rely on solid data and information that tells us these standards are just not conducive to a healthy home environment. In the summer you can certainly still open your windows and doors. But when it is so hot you don't want to be outside, a ventilation system provides a comfortably cool environment with fresh air continuously circulating. The filtering system takes care of dust and pollens, keeping you allergy free. In the winter, depending on your living style, a ventilation system may mean you won’t even need extra heating.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At eHaus, this is our standard. We will never build a home without good thermally broken windows, substantial insulation and a ventilation system: the recipe for a warm, healthy and energy-efficient home that’s better for your well-being and kinder to your pocket.</p>

<p>At eHaus we have always maintained the importance of keeping a home at an even temperature, so a home does not overheat in the summer or get too cold in the winter. Energy modelling &amp; managing solar gain at the design stage will mitigate the excessive heat problems in the summer, and is something we do for every project we design. </p>

Ventilation has not been adequately considered as part of the H1 discussion either, contributing to poor air quality and moisture damage.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recent developments at the central government level bring significant changes to construction procedures. The Cabinet has recently greenlit a bill aimed at expediting the approval process of major projects. While the focus initially lies outside the residential sector, this move promises to accelerate developments through the approval process, a welcome change for developers who have long faced obstacles delaying their projects and, in some cases, leading to cancellations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, updates to the Building Act have been announced, including:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Recognition of overseas building product standards, eliminating the need for costly verification by New Zealand designers or builders.</li><li>Authorisation for Building Consent Authorities to accept products meeting specific overseas standards that are equivalent to or surpass those in New Zealand.</li><li>Approval of building products certified through overseas certification schemes.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These revisions mark a significant shift in the industry, aimed at reducing building costs without compromising quality, a priority for eHaus. This not only makes construction and renovation more accessible and affordable but also bolsters New Zealand's resilience to recent supply chain disruptions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Minister for Building and Construction, Chris Penk, recently explained to Kerre Woodham, from <a href=""https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/on-air/kerre-woodham-mornings/audio/chris-penk-minister-for-building-and-construction-on-the-changes-to-the-building-act-allowing-products-with-reputable-overseas-certification/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Newstalk ZB, why these changes are welcome news and an ""easy win"".</a></p>

<p>Prime Minister Chris Luxon, alongside Whanganui MP Carl Bates and Whanganui Mayor Andrew Tripe, visited Tasman Estate in Whanganui on Friday. Hosted by eHaus and Sustainabuilt Developments, the visit showcased their pioneering efforts in energy-efficient home construction and sustainable development.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Initiated by Whanganui MP Carl Bates, the visit aimed to shed light on the innovative work being done by eHaus. During the tour, eHaus highlighted its track record of exceeding minimum building code requirements, emphasising its commitment to reducing carbon (To date all eHaus builds have saved a combined total 1,807,829kg of carbon) and setting new standards in energy-efficient home construction.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Discussions with the Prime Minister revolved around key challenges and opportunities in the building industry, including proposed amendments to the Building Act, the need to amend the Resource Management Act (RMA) to streamline consenting processes, national alignment of building authorities, standardisation of building products, and facilitating access to internationally certified products.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prime Minister Luxon had the chance to explore a recently completed eHaus and observe three others under construction at Tasman Estate, gaining firsthand insight into the benefits of high-performing building practices. Conversations emphasised the importance of prioritising the construction of healthy, comfortable homes that surpass minimum building code standards, and to ensure our old buildings are retrofitted so they are healthy and aren’t wasting energy.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Housing affordability was also discussed, with an emphasis on the need for a comprehensive approach. Affordability should not simply refer to the initial purchase price but must also consider long-term running costs, health benefits (thereby reducing pressure on the national health system), lower maintenance, low carbon emissions, and reduced energy consumption.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Situated just a short drive from Whanganui town centre, Tasman Estate combines the convenience of urban living with the tranquillity of the countryside. The subdivision boasts 42 sections of various sizes, offering residents picturesque views of the Tasman Sea. All homes within Tasman Estate are architecturally designed, energy-efficient and guaranteed to save carbon, reflecting a commitment to sustainable living.</p>

<p>Welcome to our Lydia Place Build Diary, where we will share the exciting journey of an eHaus build in Manawatu.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting with a vacant section on Lydia Place, we'll follow the eHaus Manawatu team as they break ground and construct a stunning 3-bedroom eHaus Pacific home. Throughout this journey, you'll see the team erect frames, install insulation and air and weather tightness layers, and learn about uPVC windows and the service cavity. We will also explore how eHaus’ are warmer, healthier, and higher performing than conventional houses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This beautifully designed home, crafted by Stapleton Elliott, is being built for the owner of eHaus Manawatu. With the plans already consented by council, site works are set to begin in the next few weeks.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stay tuned as we document each step, providing insights and updates on this exciting build project.</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2-scaled.jpg""><img src=""https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2-1024x320.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-16806""/></a></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The recent announcement that Chris Penk wants to roll back the 2023 H1 changes is outrageous. For a long time, New Zealand has been lagging behind the rest of the world when it comes to quality building construction, and removing the H1 improvements will be another step backwards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the H1 changes introduced in 2023 were a step in the right direction, there are omissions in the new legislation which we knew would lead to overheating and moisture issues in buildings. Overheating is not caused by too much insulation or higher-performing windows but rather a lack of knowledge about how to design homes that perform well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is established international building science that clearly and easily explains how to build a home that will perform well in winter and summer. Using existing building science delivers a home that is healthy for its occupants without requiring huge amounts of power to heat or cool it. We know that applying this building science to homes in New Zealand’s climate works.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <a href=""https://www.stuff.co.nz/home-property/350345208/government-considers-rolling-back-insulation-standards"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">article published on 16 July 2024 </a>states that “government experts told Penk the old standards were ""significantly lower"" than other countries with similar climates, including relevant parts of Australia, the UK, Ireland, and the US.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>So why is the government ignoring internationally recognised science and not using it to shape our building legislation, even though they know we can do better? </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It appears the answer is because of pressure from some ignorant and short-sighted members of the building industry who do not understand building science and good design.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Within the New Zealand building code, there currently aren’t any requirements to design or build a home that will perform well. There is no requirement for the designer to consider overheating in summer, or condensation and low temperatures in winter. As it stands currently, it’s a complete lottery as to how well a home will perform and you won’t know who has won or lost the draw until the home is built.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We believe low building standards and the resulting poor-performing homes is unacceptable, and that all New Zealanders deserve a warm and dry home to live in. We implore Chris Penk and the government to rethink the rollback of H1 improvements, and instead take a step further and introduce performance requirements to the legislation. Until there are performance requirements in the legislation, we will continue to have brand new homes that don’t perform well, resulting in its occupants receiving excessive energy bills to cover heating and cooling costs. Rolling back the H1 improvements won’t change that.</p>

<p>We had an incredible national conference last week, bringing together our regional teams and sponsors for a few days of learning, inspiration, and connection. This annual gathering is always a highlight, and this year was no exception!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hosted by the fantastic eHaus Manawatu team, we visited two remarkable eHaus properties in the region, showcasing the impressive work and dedication that goes into creating high-performance homes. It was inspiring to see the quality and innovation firsthand, reminding us of the value we bring to our clients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We also had the privilege of hearing from Jarrod Kerr, Chief Economist at Kiwibank, who shared an encouraging update on the current state of the economy. His insights set a positive tone for our sessions, sparking some great discussions among the teams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Throughout the conference, we celebrated achievements, shared insights, and explored new ways to continue driving excellence in our work. A massive thank you to eHaus Manawatu for hosting us, and to all our regional teams and sponsors for making the event a success. Your dedication and enthusiasm are what make these gatherings so valuable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

17033,"Is Passive House Certification right for your project?","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Not all eHaus' are certified Passive Houses but rest assured that every eHaus is designed and built to deliver exceptional living experiences, without compromise. While only our eHaus Euro homes have the potential to be certified as Passive Houses, our eHaus Pacific homes still undergo the same rigorous internal checks and processes. Though they don’t meet the stringent Passive House criteria, eHaus Pacific homes are awarded eHaus verification upon completion, following a final airtightness test. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":17035,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""media""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PassivHaus-explained-scaled.jpg""><img src=""https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PassivHaus-explained-1024x819.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-17035""/></a></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>The five Passive House principles are: </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Insulation: High levels of insulation minimises heat loss in winter and keeps the home cool in summer. </li><li>Airtightness: Creating an air and weather tight envelope is an essential element to a high-performing home to ensure there are no unwanted drafts and warm air can’t escape.</li><li>Thermal bridge-free construction: Preventing heat from escaping through weak points in the building envelope. </li><li>Windows: High performance window glazing and joinery are used to maximise heat gains in winter while minimising losses. </li><li>Ventilation: A Mechanical Heat Recover Ventilation (MHRV) system ensures a constant supply of fresh air while retaining warmth from outgoing air.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Achieving Passive House certification is a rigorous process that ensures your building meets the highest standards of energy efficiency, comfort, and sustainability. But is it worth it for your eHaus? Let’s explore the certification process and help you decide. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Why certify?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Certification provides a level of assurance that your home will perform to the Passive House standard, which guarantees: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Energy savings: Certified Passive Houses use up to 90% less energy for heating and cooling compared to conventional homes. </li><li>Comfort and health: These homes are designed for optimal indoor air quality, consistent temperatures, and superior insulation, contributing to a healthier living environment. </li><li>Property value: Passive House certification is an independent quality stamp that can increase your home's market value, as it assures future owners of its energy performance. </li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>What’s involved in certification? </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Passive House certification process involves several stages, each ensuring that your home is designed and built to meet the Passive House standard. Here's a brief overview of what to expect: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li> Design: Designing a home to meet Passive House standards requires following specific design principles, even if they challenge your architectural dreams. </li><li>Material selection: To meet Passive House standards, materials must either be certified or have proven performance data available to be specified. </li><li> Initial check: Early in the planning stage, an independent Passive House Certifier reviews your project’s design to flag any potential issues. </li><li>Preliminary review: During the design phase, all plans, including insulation and ventilation systems, are submitted for review. The Certifier checks them against the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) to ensure your project meets energy performance goals. </li><li>Final review: After construction is complete, the Certifier conducts a thorough review, which includes airtightness test verification, and verification of systems such as heating and ventilation. Only projects that pass all criteria are awarded certification. </li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>What's the cost to certify a Passive House?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The cost of certification varies depending on the complexity of your project. The pricing for a family home ranges from $8,000 to $12,000. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>To certify or not to certify? </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not all eHaus clients opt for certification, but if you’re looking to ensure your home achieves the highest standards in energy efficiency, comfort, and sustainability, certification can be a valuable investment. Whether you choose to certify or not, building an eHaus guarantees performance that far exceeds conventional homes. If you’re building an eHaus Euro and want to ensure your home reaches the highest possible performance standards, Passive House certification is a solid investment in both your home and its long-term value. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please note that the certification process is reviewed regularly, and some requirements are beyond our control. While every effort will be made to achieve certification, it cannot be guaranteed.</p>

<p>The recent <a href=""https://buildingtoday.co.nz/2024/12/03/major-branz-study-reveals-marked-gap-between-perceived-and-actual-health-of-kiwi-homes/?mc_cid=6685cedad7&amp;mc_eid=cc369a81a9"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">BRANZ study</a> on the health of New Zealand homes sheds light on a reality we at eHaus have been addressing for years: too many Kiwi homes remain cold, damp, and unhealthy. While it’s promising to see some progress in home temperatures and insulation compared to 20 years ago, the findings also underline how far we still have to go to provide truly healthy living environments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At eHaus, we’ve long recognised the direct link between home performance and health outcomes. International research and resources clearly show how high-performing, energy-efficient homes can drastically improve living conditions, yet New Zealand has been slow to adopt these proven solutions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The good news? We’re seeing a growing awareness among Kiwis about the importance of building better. More people are asking the right questions about insulation, ventilation, and airtightness — all critical to creating a home that stays warm, dry, and free of mould. However, we need broader systemic change to make this the standard, not the exception.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We hope the findings from this report will spark meaningful action at the government level, driving policy changes that prioritise building performance as a health and climate necessity, ensuring everyone in Aotearoa can live in a safe, healthy, and sustainable environment.</p>

<p><br>We’re excited to see our fantastic clients Helene and Stefan’s beautiful eHaus feature in Stuff this week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Their journey is a familiar one. After moving back to Taranaki after 10 years in Europe, they were shocked by the temperature fluctuations in a standard house, and with how cold and inefficient many houses here are.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We realised that building was the only real option if we wanted that same level of comfort [as overseas] and to have an energy-efficient house,” Stefan says.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At eHaus, our hope is that more New Zealanders will have this same realisation about the quality of our housing stock, and expect more from their homes – demanding energy efficiency and comfort, especially when building a new home.</p>

17338,"What's the difference between a standard house and a high-performing home?","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When planning to build or buy a home, it's easy to focus on location, size, and aesthetics. But what about performance? A home's performance - how efficiently it uses energy, maintains comfort, and promotes health - can make a world of difference to your quality of life, your monthly bills and long-term maintenance, and the environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this blog, we break down the key differences between a <strong>standard house</strong> built to the minimum building code in New Zealand and a <strong>high-performing home</strong> designed to exceed the minimum requirements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is established international building science that clearly outlines how to build a home that will perform well in winter and summer. Applying the existing building science delivers a home that is healthy and comfy for its occupants without requiring huge amounts of power to heat or cool it. We know that applying this building science to homes in New Zealand’s climate works too, because we have designed and built over 160 homes using these building principles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Within the New Zealand building code, there currently aren’t any requirements to design or build a home that will perform well. There is no requirement to measure overheating in summer, or the risk of condensation and low temperatures in winter. When building to the minimum building code, it’s a complete lottery as to how well a home will perform and you won’t know who has won or lost the draw until the home is built.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>So, what is the difference between a home built to the minimum building code and a high-performing home?</strong></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Built to meet the minimum building code requirements, there is no consideration at the design or build stage of how much energy the home will consumer.</li><li>Typically relies heavily on heating and cooling systems to stay comfortable, resulting in higher energy bills.</li></ul>

<p><strong>High-Performing Home:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Uses advanced design and materials to minimise the amount of energy required.</li><li>Features such as high-quality insulation, airtight construction, and energy-efficient windows keep warmth in during winter and heat out during summer.</li><li>Heating and cooling costs can be reduced by up to <strong>90%</strong> compared to a standard house.</li></ul>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Standard House:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Consumes more energy for heating, cooling, and everyday use, which increases carbon emissions.</li><li>Often constructed with less consideration for sustainable materials or waste reduction.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>High-Performing Home:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Dramatically reduces energy consumption, lowering your carbon footprint.</li><li>Many high-performing homes integrate renewable energy solutions, like solar panels, to generate clean power further reducing the environmental impact.</li><li>Sustainable building materials and practices minimise environmental impact during construction.</li></ul>

<p><strong>6. Long-Term Costs</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Standard House:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Lower upfront build costs but higher operational expenses every year because of the higher energy use and more ongoing maintenance.</li><li>Over time, the price of comfort can add up.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>High-Performing Home:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>While the initial investment may be slightly higher (between 9-17% more), the savings in energy bills, maintenance, and the overall comfort offset the upfront cost multiple times over the life of the building.</li><li>Provides long-term financial benefits and peace of mind.</li></ul>

<p><strong>So, which home is right for you?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A standard house may meet basic needs, but a high-performing home offers greater comfort, health, and energy efficiency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A high-performing home prioritises comfort, energy efficiency, health, and sustainability – and we believe these should be consider when designing and building any new home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At eHaus, we specialise in designing and building high-performing homes that deliver on every level. Whether you're looking for reduced energy bills, a healthier living environment, or a smaller carbon footprint, a high-performing home is the smarter choice for today and the future.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Are you concerned about new homes overheating? You're not alone. Recent media coverage and government updates to the H1 Building Code have highlighted these issues, but many of the proposed changes still miss the mark. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By November 2023, the final tranche of MBIE’s changes to the H1 Building Code were in effect. While these updates aimed to make homes more energy efficient, little thought was attributed to managing solar gain in the summer which created an over-heating problem. Ventilation was not adequately considered either, contributing to poor air quality and moisture damage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At eHaus, we know the real problem isn’t too much insulation or high-performing windows—it’s a lack of understanding about how to design homes for year-round comfort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this webinar you will learn about the building science that makes it possible to design and build a comfortable, healthy home no matter where it is built in the country. We’ll explore how:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Homes can maintain a comfortable temperature all year round.</li><li>Fresh, filtered air and no condensation are achievable with good design.</li><li>Energy modelling during the design stage ensures your home avoids overheating and moisture risks.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This approach allows us to predict the risk of overheating with a high degree of accuracy and eliminate any risk at the design stage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ll have a Q&amp;A at the end, and you can submit your questions when you register or send them through during the event.</p>

<p>Exciting news - we've officially broken ground on our eHaus in Lydia Place, Manawatu! We kicked off the build journey on 27 January 2025, marking the first step towards bringing our high-performing, energy-efficient home to life. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The initial site scrape is complete, along with the garage excavation and backfill, which have now been signed off by our engineers. This essential groundwork lays the foundation for what’s to come, ensuring everything is set up for a smooth build.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next up: construction of the garage. We’re expecting the reinforcing steel to arrive later this week, and once it’s on-site, we’ll be straight into the next phase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can find out more about the design of this home on our <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/project/lydia/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">project page here.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’re looking forward to sharing our progress as we bring this eHaus to life - stay tuned for updates! </p>

<p>At the start of 2010, no one in New Zealand was building homes to the Passive House standard. In March 2025 eHaus marks their 15<sup>th</sup> birthday, celebrating 15 years of building homes that outperform the norm - whether to full Passive House certification or the high-performing eHaus Euro and eHaus Pacific standards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two of the founders, Jon Iliffe and Baden Brown were among the first to sit and pass the Passive House Certified Designer exam in NZ, and we provided the energy modelling and consultation for the first ever certified Passive House in New Zealand in 2010.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting out in Whanganui, eHaus quickly grew with new homes completed in Taranaki and Wairarapa in 2011. The early days of eHaus involved numerous home shows and educating people about the health, comfort and energy efficiency of high-performing homes. Our journey included designing and building New Zealand’s <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/project/parthenay-whanganui/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">first certified Passive House Plus</a>, winning multiple Master Builder House of the Year awards around the country, collaborating on <a href=""https://ehaus.co.nz/project/dunedin-co-housing-project/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">New Zealand’s first certified Passive House co-housing development</a>, and several TV interviews.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To celebrate our birthday, we have reconnected with some of our original eHaus clients to see firsthand the positive impact their homes have had on their lives and check how the homes are performing after all this time.</p>

<p>Ian and Heather have lived in the first eHaus since 2013, which was built in 2010 as a Passive House prototype, and have always appreciated its warmth and ambience. “It’s a special feeling living here. It stays clean, so I don’t have to dust, and we don’t get colds now days” says Heather. Even after 15 years, their home remains highly efficient, with an 87% predicted heat energy saving and 40,090kg of carbon saved as of March 2025. Retesting confirmed its airtightness at 1.1 air changes per hour - an impressive result for its age. Their power bills remain low, typically between $140-$160 and never exceeding $200.</p>

<p>Verena and Rudolf designed and built Taranaki’s first eHaus in 2012, drawing inspiration from their Swiss heritage, where energy-efficient homes were the norm. Their eHaus Euro was modelled to achieve 94% heat energy savings and has saved 57,276kg of carbon to date. The initial airtightness test returned an impressive 0.38 air changes per hour, and more than a decade later, a retest showed just a slight change to 0.51 AC n50, proving its enduring performance. “It feels comfortable. It’s not moist, and there’s no condensation,” says Verena.</p>

<p>Jeff and Renate moved into their eHaus Euro in 2013, determined to improve on their past homes in the UK and New Zealand. With a predicted heat energy saving of 95%, their Whanganui home has already saved 42,480kg of carbon. Their 5KW solar panels and solar thermal hot water system drastically reduce costs, with a July 2024 power bill of just $138 and only $23 in January 2025, including charging their EV. Jeff sums it up: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><p>“If you’re thinking of building a new home, then building a standard house is the worst decision you could ever make. Build a high performing home!”</p><cite>Jeff Williams, eHaus home owner</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While it may seem incredible that these eHaus’ are still performing so well after 12-15 years with minimal maintenance and providing the inhabitants with a comfy home every day, to eHaus Directors Jon, Baden and Glenda, it comes as absolutely no surprise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As a builder, I saw firsthand how normal New Zealand homes failed to perform. These stories from our early clients are exactly what we expected. They show that an eHaus isn’t just a short-term fix for cold and damp living conditions - it’s a long-term solution for better, healthier homes that need less energy.” says Baden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before eHaus, Baden and Glenda owned their own building company, building homes to the minimum building code, and Jon was a mechanical engineer for Rolls Royce. They were disillusioned with the poor performance of supposedly high-end quality homes in New Zealand, so they came together, seeking better solutions. Having been through the PHINZ training and being involved in over 150 high performing eHaus’ since then, they now know that applying smart building science and measuring the performance through energy modelling at the design stage, results in a home that will actually last – and perform well – forever.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><p>“Fifteen years ago, we set out to prove that homes in New Zealand could be built to a much higher standard  -  homes that were not just warm and dry, but really energy efficient, comfortable, and healthy to live in. Today, our clients’ experiences and latest testing speaks for itself.” </p><cite>Jon, eHaus Director</cite></blockquote>

<h4>As part of our 15<sup>th</sup> birthday celebrations, we visited three of our original clients to see firsthand the impact their homes have had on their lives and check how the homes are performing after all this time. Here is the first of three client stories, make sure you check out the other stories too.</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ian and Heather live in the first eHaus developed and built in 2010 as a prototype, used to test the theory of Passive House and the newly developed New Zealand climate data. While Ian and Heather weren’t involved in the design and build process, they have lived there since 2013.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ian and Heather were farmers in their younger days, living in a drafty and cold house on a farm that had been in their family for over 140 years. When they retired, they moved to a much warmer home on a lifestyle block that still had plenty of room for their much-loved animals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They lived there for 14 years and never intended on moving into town. Ian attended an eHaus event at the prototype and his friends who also visited loved the home so much, they convinced the pair that they needed to buy it. They were reluctant to move initially as there was no space for their animals, but the move into town and a high-performing home made sense to them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ian became a bus driver after leaving the farm and was previously involved in the local government. Both are passionate about gardening, to the extent that Ian has become the unofficial caretaker for the council reserve next door. When they moved in, the reserve was overgrown and unloved. The council mowed it, but the garden was neglected. Ian lovingly tidied it up and planted rhododendrons, magnolias, hydrangeas and more, along with mowing it regularly, for the neighbours to enjoy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They are very settled in their eHaus and have always appreciated the ambience and warmth it provides. “It’s a special feeling living here. It stays clean, so I don’t have to dust, and we don’t get colds now days” says Heather. Ian adds “it’s quiet and you can’t hear the cars outside. When I was young, I had asthma, but not anymore.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Performance</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>15 years on, this prototype is still performing incredibly well. Their home has a predicted heat energy saving of 87% and as of 10 March 2025, has saved 40,090kg of carbon! It is classified as a PHI Low Energy home, which targets one air change per hour (1AC n50) or less to maintain high energy efficiency. When we visited Ian and Heather, we retested the airtightness of their home, and after 15 years, it still has a result of 1.1 air changes per hour  –  an amazing result given the age of the home! Ian says, “our power bills are typically between $140-$160 and have never been over $200”.</p>

Both from the UK and now retired, Renate was a nurse and Jeff owned retail shops in the UK, following a stint in the army as a radio technician. To date, their home in Whanganui has saved an impressive 42,480kg of carbon thanks to the predicted heat energy savings of 95%! &nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having lived in the UK and built two houses before, the couple felt they should be able to improve on their past homes. When they heard about eHaus building high performing homes, they began their own research which “proved very decisively that this was the right way to build,” says Jeff. “Our UK house performance was good but did require central heating and a log fire. Our first NZ build was reasonable but as soon as the sun went down the heat disappeared through the walls and poor-quality windows, even though they were double glazed!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now in their eHaus, with the interior design done by Renate and carpentry, electrical and plumbing work completed by Jeff, Jeff says the home is “exactly what we wanted and more. Having a ventilation system and fresh air all the time is my favourite aspect.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I have been in houses in New Zealand where it’s quite uncomfortable in most of the rooms. Windows are dripping with condensation. The cost of keeping this type of home must be crippling.” But that is not the case for Jeff and Renate who live in comfort every day. The 5KW photovoltaic solar panels and solar thermal hot water systems means the home generates its own energy, providing huge savings, and in the middle of a New Zealand winter, had a power bill of $138 (July 2024) and in January 2025 it was only $23 (and that includes charging the Electric Vehicle!).</p>

<h4>As part of our 15<sup>th</sup> birthday celebrations, we visited three of our original clients to see firsthand the impact their homes have had on their lives and check how the homes are performing after all this time. Here is the last story in our birthday series, make sure you check out the other stories too.</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Verena and Rudolf live in the first eHaus in Taranaki which they designed and built in 2012. Growing up in Switzerland Rudolf lived in a house from 1760, and Verena’s was built in 1603, however it was common to have an energy efficient home there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arriving from Switzerland 52 years ago on their OE, they fell in love with New Zealand and decided to stay. For most of their working lives, they were also farmers in Stratford then Oakura, living in farmhouses built to the minimum building code. One of their homes was so inefficient and lacked weather tightness that “when we water blasted the cladding, the water would seep inside of the house” says Verena.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During a trip home in the 1990’s they attended an open day at a low-energy house in the village where Verena grew up. Building an energy-efficient and high-performing felt right to the couple, but it wasn’t until 2011 that they started researching someone to build a new home for them – perfect timing as the eHaus website had just launched.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Their eHaus Euro provides a comfy home for the couple and when asked what their favourite aspect of living in an eHaus is, Verena says “It feels comfortable. It’s not moist and there’s no condensation. I can hang up my towel at night and its dry in the morning.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the home was designed, the eHaus energy modelling showed their home would have 94% predicted heat energy savings and as at 10 March 2025, has saved a whopping 57,276kg of carbon. When the build was complete, the final airtightness test gave a result of 0.38 air changes per hour, well below the maximum 0.6 AC n50 required for Passive House certification.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When asked about their power bills and the performance of their home, Verena says “the performance has never changed.” Their monthly power bills range between $220-$250 but Verena is quick to point out that they are charging an electric car, pump their own water, and have a large workshop with machinery which all uses more power than a typical home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The recent airtightness test result was 0.51 AC n50. Verena was right, while there was a slight change from the 2012 result, their home is still performing within the requirements of a Passive House all these years later.</p>

<p>Getting Lydia Pl out of the ground has been a carefully coordinated process, with each stage requiring close collaboration between our team, engineers, and Council.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We kicked off with the foundation footings for the garage and landscaping retaining walls, followed by the blockwork for both the garage and one of the retaining walls. From there, we moved into tanking and protecting the exterior garage walls before installing drainage and completing the backfilling – a critical step for site stability and safety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the backfilling complete, we were able to move onto piling. Using an auger, the team drilled pile holes for both the house and decks. Despite challenging weather conditions, they pushed through to prepare the piles and garage slab for concrete. A major milestone was achieved when we poured the concrete for both the piles and the garage slab on the same day. The piles were completed using a line pump and tremie method to displace the water and ensure a solid pour.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’re proud of the progress so far and excited for what’s next – constructing the sub-floor and watching Lydia Pl begin to take shape above ground.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stay tuned for more updates as this beautiful build continues.</p>

<p>Jee and Peng had been thinking about downsizing for a while when they heard about a parcel of land being developed. They visited the piece of land and were besotted by the magnificent views and immediately decided to pay a deposit on the site.

Fast forward to today, now living in their new eHaus, they wouldn’t do anything differently and their one tip for others looking to build, is to consider eHaus.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At eHaus, we welcome the decision not to<a> </a><a href=""https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/522288/government-considers-rolling-back-insulation-standards"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">roll back higher insulation standards</a><a> </a>and to acknowledge the role insulation plays in improving the health, comfort, and energy performance of New Zealand homes. We commend the Minister for listening to the industry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We agree that increased insulation alone does not cause overheating. However, our experience delivering high-performance homes has shown that simply adding more insulation without considering essential design factors such as orientation, glazing, shading and ventilation, can contribute to overheating and owner discomfort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Insulation is a critical part of the solution, but it must be integrated into a holistic design approach. High-performance homes are the result of careful planning and attention to detail at every stage, not insulation in isolation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regarding affordability, while higher insulation levels can increase upfront construction costs, there is extensive evidence both <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1808149/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">internationally</a> and in <a href=""https://www.phcc.org.nz/briefing/new-zealands-hard-won-improvements-our-building-code-must-be-retained-heres-why"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">New Zealand</a> demonstrating that the long-term benefits (including reduced energy use, improved health outcomes, increasing work productivity) more than justify the initial investment. It is important that policymakers and industry leaders continue to communicate clear, evidence-based information about these benefits to homeowners and builders alike.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>eHaus remains committed to delivering homes that are warm in winter, cool in summer, and healthy all year round. Through high performance design principles and rigorous construction standards, we can achieve buildings that perform exceptionally well without compromising comfort or sustained affordability.</p>

18102,"Floor prep and sweeping views","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Lydia Place, the flooring stage has been all about precision and performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To support the James Hardie Secura flooring, our floor joists were spaced closer than standard. This dense fibre cement product was selected for its acoustic properties, essential given the home’s location close to a flight path and it also contributes to airtightness, a key factor in high performance homes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the flooring was laid, we landed the wall frames and brought in Scafit to stand the scaffolding. This gave our team a safe and stable platform to proceed with standing the frames and begin shaping the gable forms and glazed dining link that define the home’s Japandi-inspired architecture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the flooring laid, we reached a moment where the design began to come to life. Standing on the completed floor, we now fully appreciate the end views, sweeping across native bush and out toward the Tararua Ranges. It’s a powerful reminder of why this site was chosen and how the home’s layout is designed to frame and celebrate those vistas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This stage is a turning point where the structure begins to reflect the vision.</p>

18128,"Waikato Times article: How a high performance home changes life","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Craig and Melissa Lawrence used to live in a house so cold, damp and draughty that they’d find slugs on the hallway floor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We wanted a home that’s a constant and comfortable temperature year-round, with low moisture levels and minimal energy usage to achieve it. The idea that you can come home from work or school on a miserable winter’s day - or hot summer’s day - and walk into a house at a comfortable temperature, was a huge drawcard.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The result is a new high performance eHaus, that’s the same comfortable 18 to 19 degree temperature every morning, without heating on, even when it’s -1 degree in Cambridge, as it has been this month.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The build at Lydia Place is rising fast and during May we hit a major milestone: wall and roof framing was underway!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This isn’t your standard framing job. At Lydia, we’re building smarter from the inside out. One of the key differences? Our external walls are 140mm thick, compared to the typical 90mm you’d find in most New Zealand homes. That extra 50mm might not sound like much, but it makes a big difference, allowing us to pack in 50% more insulation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ve also installed the dwangs on their edge, rather than flat, which allows for a continuous layer of insulation between the studs. This small and clever detail helps eliminate thermal bridging and supports the airtightness and energy efficiency we’re aiming for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why does that matter? More insulation and better detailing mean improved thermal performance — essential for achieving the eHaus Pacific criteria we’re targeting. It helps keep the home warm in winter, cool in summer, and energy-efficient all year round, all while creating a healthier, more comfortable living environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This stage of the build is where the structure really starts to take shape, highlighted by those four striking gable ends. You can now walk through the spaces, see the layout come to life, and get a feel for how the home will function. It’s always an exciting moment for the team and a great time to appreciate the craftsmanship and precision that goes into every detail.</p>

<div class=""wp-block-group""><!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><p>The Lydia build continues to take shape, and June marked another major milestone - roof installation. As with every stage of this high-performance home, the materials and methods we’ve chosen are intentional, durable, and designed to support high performance principles.</p><p>We’ve selected Colorsteel Maxam in a standard corrugate profile, finished in the timeless shade of Titania. This choice offers more than just good looks. Colorsteel Maxam is the next generation of Colorsteel, designed to withstand New Zealand’s diverse climate conditions, making it ideal for the Lydia build’s exposed site. The corrugate profile adds a familiar architectural rhythm, while Titania’s soft, neutral tone complements the overall palette of the home.</p><p>Choosing a light-coloured roof like Titania isn’t just an aesthetic decision, it’s a performance one. Light roofs reflect sunlight rather than absorbing it, helping to reduce overheating in summer and maintain a more stable indoor temperature. In effect, it acts like a polar ice cap, bouncing solar radiation away from the home and supporting both energy efficiency and sustainability. This passive cooling strategy reduces the need for mechanical cooling and contributes to the home's overall thermal comfort.</p><p>Beneath the steel lies a key component of our airtightness and weather protection strategy: Siga Majcoat. This premium roof underlay is a standout performer in the world of building membranes. It’s highly breathable, UV-resistant, and robust enough to support the airtightness and moisture control required for Passive House certification. By choosing Majcoat, we’re investing in long-term durability and indoor comfort.</p><p>The roof isn’t just a lid, it’s a critical layer in the home’s thermal envelope. Every product we’ve chosen contributes to the Lydia build’s goal of energy efficiency, durability, and occupant wellbeing. From the visible Colorsteel cladding to the hidden layers of Siga Majcoat, this roof is built to perform.</p></blockquote>
