Following construction the house was monitored in 2011 - 2012. The performance of the home met all the expectations and confirmed the decision for eHaus to focus on the Passive House Standard.

They wanted a quiet, healthy space that was warm all year round for their customers, so the PHI EnerPHit option was the natural approach. EnerPHit is the established standard for refurbishment of existing buildings using the Passive House approach and PHPP energy modelling tool. The Passive House Standard often cannot be feasibly achieved in older buildings due to various difficulties. Refurbishment to the EnerPHit Standard using Passive House components for all relevant structural elements in such buildings leads to extensive improvements with respect to thermal comfort, structural integrity, cost-effectiveness and energy requirements. Despite the slightly higher energy demand, it offers vmost of the advantages of the Passive House standard. The final result is a beautiful space enjoyed by many right in the heart of Whanganui city. The cafe (previously called the Petre dish) is now fine dining and vegan friendly. The Greenhouse Aotearoa is all about 'changing the health stats in New Zealand by encouraging good eating'.

Clad in cedar vertical board and batten and corrugated steel, with wood joinery and triple glazing, this home is not only simple but also beautiful. Guests have praised its outstanding performance, even in cold weather, with no need to light the fire.

This property faces North-East, to give views over paddocks, horses and foals on the property, the windows and doors in the open plan living area have been designed to frame these views.

From the Tararua Ranges and Manawatū River mouth to the small serene settlement of Foxton Beach, this hilltop home offers complete respite from the sand, wind and relentless summer sunshine. The moment you step inside, everything falls silent and still. One of the welcomed differences building an eHaus brings. Clad in vertical cedar and Colorsteel on the outside, and a combination of white-washed plywood ceilings and polished concrete floors on the inside, the material choices form a minimalist backdrop ideal for modern living. Aesthetic cues were lifted from Scandinavian and Japanese architecture - note the custom Shoji door, negative detailing, and mezzanine floor - while practical elements such as window placement and compact, built-in seating were factored into the design to maximise efficiency and comfort. This home won a Gold and took the Category Winner at the Registered Master Builder 2021 House of the Year Competition, Manawatu. This eHaus was also named in the National Top 100 homes for 2021.

This home by Hofmans Builders is a highly energy efficient house with careful planning for solar gain and smart material choices. The selection and execution of spruce and oak timbers complements the carpet, tile, and joinery units incredibly well. With exposed timber elements, this house was complex to build but was finished to a very high standard. It features a clever design, high attention to detail and meticulous construction, making it the regions supreme home. This house has truly been built by craftsmen, with the accuracy and skill of the builders being visible across the foundations, walls, and roof. Huge consideration has been given to the set out of the claddings, which are uniform and accurate. The flashings are neat and beautifully installed alongside the multi member columns and screens. It is clear the door hardware and trims have been fitted with consistency in mind, while the tiling is totally faultless, and the internal wall and ceiling linings are of a very high standard."" This home has also been independently recognised as a Certified Passive House. This home is the winner of six awards in the Registered Master Builder 2021 House of the Year Competition, including winning the Supreme Build for the Taranaki Region.

The group now known as Toiora High Street CoHousing Community purchased a 5,000 sqm site that was the former High Street Primary School and in November 2018, eHaus Otago commenced construction. The project is New Zealand’s first certified passive house co-housing development. There are 21 passive house homes, ranging in size from two bedroom to large five-bedroom homes, each with their own private outdoor area. All the homes are certified to the International Passive House ""Classic"" standard, with triple glazing, thicker wall construction, superior insulation than new conventionally built houses as well as being designed to ensure they meet the Passive House air tightness standard. Combined with individual mechanical heat recovery ventilation systems to ensure that fresh filtered air circulates the homes and keeping the temperature between 20-22 degrees all year round.

The well established family lifestyle block is beautifully set out to provide home to the family along with the dog, horses and other animals that you would expect. The architecture is as timeless as the land it sits on a with a main single pitch roof that provides the simple but iconic architecture. This is a feature of many eHaus designs as it is also the most efficient approach with less external area to provide the same amount of internal living space. The covered outdoor areas to the front and rear of the property was a must have and ensure that indoor out door flow is an option all year round. Beautifully built the home meets remarkably high standards for air tightness and energy performance, achieved through thoughtful, science driven decisions on window and door placement, investment in high performance window products and supporting ventilation systems. The four bedroom, 264m2 home is north facing, oriented to maximise light and sun into the living spaces, with generously sized windows and French doors opening to the outdoor spaces and taking in the rural setting beyond. The modern, clean line design and neutral pallet is complimented by the striking dark tones of the joinery, finished in Matt Flax Pod.

Thoughtfully designed with family living in mind, the home features two luxurious bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms and walk-in wardrobes—ideal for multi-generational living or guests. An open-plan living area with cathedral ceilings incorporates the kitchen with scullery, dining, and living area creating a seamless space for entertaining that naturally flows outdoors to a deck. A separate lounge and dedicated office provide flexibility for modern lifestyles.

Crafted with care, the attractive weatherboard exterior is complemented by polished concrete floors and warm timber accents throughout, adding a timeless, natural aesthetic.",,"eHaus - Vlada Acimovic","eHaus Hawkes Bay - Ian & Sharon Welsh","Jon Iliffe","Sustainable Engineering - Sara Wareing",0,0,20210501,field_60ac72c0e4608,15.6,field_60ac724d8e518,213,field_60ac72588e519,36,field_60ac7288e4607,30,89,field_6294449543b63,,,,,,,,,,completed,completed,0,,a:1:{i:0;i:164114;},https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/HBHN12204-28.jpg|https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/HBHN12204-29.jpg|https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/HBHN12204-24.jpg|https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/HBHN12204-23.jpg|https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/HBHN12204-17.jpg|https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/HBHN12204-16.jpg|https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/HBHN12204-11_Edited.jpg|https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/HBHN12204-8_Edited.jpg|https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/HBHN12204-1.jpg|https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/HBHN12204-30.jpg,a:10:{i:0;i:164116;i:1;i:164117;i:2;i:164118;i:3;i:164119;i:4;i:164120;i:5;i:164121;i:6;i:164122;i:7;i:164123;i:8;i:164124;i:9;i:164125;},,,,,,,PassivHaus,"Certified PassivHaus Classic | eHaus Hawkes Bay",55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,5,"Jon Iliffe",jon@ehaus.co.nz,,,hawkes-bay-te-mata-2,,,0,0,0,closed,closed,2025-06-11

Cleverly designed to provide everything required for day to day living on the ground floor with kitchen dining living and a master bedroom with ensuite and a large office/spare bedroom. But then when the family pays a visit the upstairs offers 3 more bedrooms located in 3 of the four wings and bathroom in the fourth wing. Access to the upper level is either by a central staircase or a lift. Care was taken to keep many of the original trees and complimentary new planting has already been completed. The architectural style is a nod back to the traditional country villa with deep verandas that wrap the lower level. These covered spaces create the perfect opportunity for great indoor-outdoor flow, alfresco dining along with protection from the hot summer sun.
But make no mistake that is where the comparison to country villas end, this is a very high performing home with no draughts. As well as being airtight, the European triple glazed joinery also ensures the interior temperatures are even all year round without the need for a wood burner. In fact, the Passive House Planning Package report (PHPP) shows predicted heat energy saving of 93% when compared to a new standard home.

The steep site informs the long, narrow form aligning with the hill contour. A plan-driven, playful form utilising pop-out windows and a sloping hip roof, reflecting the hilly Remutaka backdrop. A separate mudroom and outdoor shower provides a seamless transition between the farm and home.

Pop-out windows and high sloping ceilings create the illusion of larger rooms, allowing for efficient yet highly functional spaces within the small footprint. A bank of service and storage space along the southern interior face allows the house to open up to the north, maximising sun and views across the valley floor.

As a small but relatively complex space, the interior finishing is clean and minimal; a playful form both inside and out. Natural textures on the interior are informed by the surrounding environment such as warm ply lining and wax-finished concrete floors.

Sustainability and eHaus design principles are a key driver of the project. Large eaves prevent summer overheating, while small, carefully positioned windows with northern orientation capture sun and enhance energy performance.

A collection of bedrooms are nestled at the top of the sloping site, with the living spaces - both inside and outside - extending down the hill, maximising views over Lake Taupo. The natural materials of the exterior are continued inside to create a warm and inviting retreat from the busy city life.

There is absolutely no wasted space, with all 178sqm perfectly utilised. Every detail is well thought out, like the direct access from the spa to the bathroom meaning no wet feet traipsing through the house.

Despite Covid lockdowns, material shortages, and site orientation challenges, the eHaus team designed and delivered an exceptional home that the owners and guests are incredibly happy with. The high performance of the holiday home means they can come and go, knowing it will always be comfortable, dry, and healthy, whatever time or season they arrive.

Having lived in drafty and damp homes previously and with a background in interior architecture, the owners had the desire for their first home to be sustainable and functional, and every detail was to be carefully considered. Āhuru stands as a testament to their vision of combining comfort and style, with environmental responsibility. </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm;""><span style=""font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;""> </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm;""><span style=""font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"">Throughout the planning and design process, the homeowners prioritised energy efficiency and indoor comfort. Āhuru incorporates Passive House principles, ensuring exceptional thermal performance and indoor air quality. The selection of Dopfner Premium Wood Alu windows and the Zehnder ComfoAir ventilation system enable the home to meet the strict standards set for Passive House certification.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm;""><span style=""font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;""> </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm;""><span style=""font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"">Overlooking the Raglan harbour, this home features three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a large open plan kitchen and living area, plus a separate office. This exceptional home showcases well-planned details in every space – nothing happened by accident. The kitchen and living joinery, wall linings, and interior door veneers were ordered together to ensure consistency of colour and grain match throughout the home. The feature kitchen and entrance ceiling is a nod to historical construction methods and the homeowner's work. The design and construction of the bedroom wing includes significant acoustic reduction methods. These are a few, of the many, examples of the attention to detail taken by the teams involved in this project.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm;""><span style=""font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;""> </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0cm;""><span style=""font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"">The homeowner’s commitment to passive design has resulted in a home that epitomises responsible construction and living. Rainwater harvesting, and solar panels with battery storage to meet Passive House Plus standard, further reduce Āhuru's environmental impact while promoting self-sufficiency. The selection of Abodo timber weatherboards and Vulcan decking, both thermally treated products, alongside MCA treated retaining and pergola timber, reduces the extent of chemical leaching into the surrounding environment.  These elements contribute to a healthier, more sustainable living environment without compromising on comfort or architectural excellence.</span></p>

Nestled within the captivating landscape of Cromwell, New Zealand, The Boulders stands as a testament to eHaus' commitment to redefining the way we live. This project was completed in 2023 and epitomises the perfect fusion of energy efficient modern design, and a deep connection with nature.

Situated 480 meters above sea level, halfway up a rough hill slope that rises from Lake Dunstan to the Dunstan mountains, The Boulders is a haven for those seeking a peaceful, homely, and energy-efficient dwelling. The rugged location, whilst beautiful, presented the eHaus Design team with some unique challenges. The Resource Consent stipulated that the dwelling could not be visible from the lake, the colours had to fit the environment, and it had to meet the Building Code for the Extra High Wind Zone and snowfalls in Otago, yet, the house still needed to take advantage of the stunning views the elevation afforded. With this in mind, the final design inspiration was drawn from the early miner's basic shelters which were carved into the banks with a sloping canvas front. The orientation allowed for focused views of the lake and surrounding ranges. The use of roof overhangs and set-back windows helps to protect the interior spaces from the extreme climate challenges throughout the seasons.

The Boulders boasts three bedrooms, with the master featuring a spacious walk-in robe and ensuite, providing luxurious comfort to its inhabitants. A separate snug or reading room offers a cozy retreat, while the open-plan living and dining areas create a seamless flow, inviting in natural light and panoramic views of Lake Dunstan, 'Sugar Loaf,' and the Pisa Mountain Range.

The architectural details of The Boulders are nothing short of immaculate and have been implemented with precision and careful consideration. Abodo sand decking, bespoke powder-coated perforated aluminium screens on exterior windows, and a striking combination of Abodo charred cladding and schist contribute to the home's aesthetic appeal. The level of detail is evident in the negative detailing around interior doors, the kitchen fit-out, and the suspended layered ceiling designed to represent schist. The sloping external walls not only add to the visual interest but also seamlessly integrate the home into the rugged landscape.
<h5>The Boulders is not just a dwelling; it's a retreat that harmonises with its surroundings while embracing the principles of energy efficiency and modern living.</h5>
Notably, The Boulders adheres to the eHaus Euro low energy performance standard, setting a benchmark for energy efficiency in residential construction. This eHaus masterpiece offers a perfect blend of form and function, catering to the discerning preferences of the owners.

Carefully nestled among the existing Kahikatea trees, which were safeguarded from disturbance, our team meticulously dug by hand around the semi-surfaced roots, preserving the natural habitat.

Designed and built with precision and care, this home boasts exceptional performance, thanks to a selection of premium materials. From insulated and airtight attic stairs to the Zehnder ComfoAir 180 ventilation unit, wood-alu joinery, and a composting toilet - each component was thoughtfully chosen to deliver a healthy and comfy home.

Embracing sustainability at every turn, all treated timber utilised in construction underwent ACQ treatment - an arsenic and chrome-free alternative to using CCA treated timber, and all products were free from formaldehyde, in harmony with our ecoValues and drive to provide sustainable and eco-friendly products.

All roof water is channelled through a high-density polyethylene pipe to the stainless steel storage water tank, where it is stored and ready for use. This water is then pumped to the kitchen and vanity for drinking, ensuring a reduced contaminant and sustainable water source. Overflow from the stainless tank is directed into the plastic storage water tank, which is pumped to the shower, laundry, and hose taps, providing a comprehensive water solution. All tank water goes thorough filtration, passing through separate UV water filters before entering the house, ensuring that water quality remains pristine and safe for consumption.

This exceptional home meets the eHaus Euro PHI Low Energy standard, highlighting the dedication of its owners and eHaus to not only create a high performing home, but also to honour and preserve the land it sits on.

This unique residence features a self-contained apartment, perfect for parents seeking independence, as well as a dedicated bedroom wing for guests and grown-up children. This wing can be easily closed off when not in use, providing privacy and flexibility for family members.

The living space is expertly organised into distinct zones, allowing for both shared experiences and personal moments. At the rear of the home, the master suite offers a peaceful retreat, complemented by a utility space that enhances daily living. Additional features include a separate office, ideal for remote work, along with ample storage areas tailored to the family's hobbies and interests.

Wakefield is designed to showcase the owners’ passion for art, with hallways specifically created to display their favourite pieces. This thoughtful detail adds character and personal touch throughout the home. The concept design was completed by Arthouse Architects and then given to Ross Bennett to execute the energy efficient detail design.

The exterior of Wakefield is clad predominantly in stained cedar with a durable Colorsteel roof. A bespoke timber entrance door invites guests in, while concrete wall panels provide a modern contrast. The property has been fully landscaped, with a professional design that reflects the owners’ vision, executed beautifully by both the owners and the builders. Notably, repurposed jetty sleepers have been creatively incorporated as house posts, garden edging, and pergola elements, adding a rustic touch to the overall aesthetic.

Inside, the home features polished concrete floors that lend an industrial feel. The design incorporates textured wallpapers and a vibrant palette of high-contrast paint colours, softened by thoughtfully chosen window treatments. Custom cabinetry throughout the home enhances functionality, with special features like a cozy window seat and built-in bookcases that add charm to the living spaces, including the kitchen and storage areas.

17106,"Ti Kiteroa","<strong>History</strong>

The original Te Kiteroa Homestead was built by Emily Phillips in 1913. Emily’s story is a fascinating one—born in London, she married James Phillips, who was from New Zealand. Together, they voyaged to Nelson to embark on a new life. The marriage was short-lived, and Emily moved on to become the lifelong housekeeper of the successful businessman, Allan McLean. Allan established the extensive Waikākahi Estate and, in his retirement, built the 53-room ‘McLean Mansion’ in Christchurch. At the time of his death in 1907, Allan was one of the world’s wealthiest men. He provided Emily with wealth for life, enabling her to (at the age of 76) build Te Kiteroa Homestead plus two cottages for her chauffeur and gardener. She named the homestead Te Kiteroa, meaning “the long view.” Known as the “grand lady on the hill,” Emily resided in her 598m2 homestead until her death in 1921. Between 1945 and 1978, Te Kiteroa was owned by the Women’s Division of Federated Farmers, providing a place of refuge for farmers’ wives and operating a “relief housekeeper” scheme. Innovation is a recurring theme throughout the history of Te Kiteroa. Find out more at tekiteroalodge.co.nz

<strong>Recent years</strong>

Te Kiteroa Lodge was purchased by Gary and Ann Dennison in 1991. They expanded the hosted guest lodge accommodation to include a vineyard, winery, and restaurant known as Point Bush Estates. Te Kiteroa was a widely-recognised iconic historic homestead, hosting an array of weddings, events and retreats. In 2019, the Dennisons established a predator-fenced 95-hectare ecosanctuary adjacent to Te Kiteroa Lodge, featuring
native bush with popular recreational walking and mountain bike tracks. In May 2012, Te Kiteroa sadly succumbed to a devastating fire and was unable to be saved. Gary and Ann were able to reside in one of the cottages, but the loss of their beloved lodge was heartbreaking, a feeling that was shared among many locals.

<strong>The future</strong>

The new Te Kiteroa Eco Lodge will be a 512m2 eHaus Euro, targeting passive house certification. It will comprise two adjoining but separate wings, together totalling seven bedrooms, each with private bathrooms. The two open-plan kitchen and living areas will be east-facing to the coastline and sunrise. The tranquil setting with stunning views and starry night skies is a legacy that lives on. The eHaus energy-efficiency model aligns well with Gary and Ann’s passion for sustainability and conservation.

</strong>The original Te Kiteroa Homestead was built by Emily Phillips in 1913. Emily’s story is a fascinating one—born in London, she married James Phillips, who was from New Zealand. Together, they voyaged to Nelson to embark on a new life. The marriage was short-lived, and Emily moved on to become the lifelong housekeeper of the successful businessman, Allan McLean. Allan established the extensive Waikākahi Estate and, in his retirement, built the 53-room ‘McLean Mansion’ in Christchurch. At the time of his death in 1907, Allan was one of the world’s wealthiest men. He provided Emily with wealth for life, enabling her to (at the age of 76) build Te Kiteroa Homestead plus two cottages for her chauffeur and gardener. She named the homestead Te Kiteroa, meaning “the long view.” Known as the “grand lady on the hill,” Emily resided in her 598m2 homestead until her death in 1921. Between 1945 and 1978, Te Kiteroa was owned by the Women’s Division of Federated Farmers, providing a place of refuge for farmers’ wives and operating a “relief housekeeper” scheme. Innovation is a recurring theme throughout the history of Te Kiteroa. Find out more at <a href=""https://www.tekiteroa.co.nz/page/history/"">tekiteroa.co.nz</a>

<strong>Recent years
</strong>Te Kiteroa Lodge was purchased by Gary and Ann Dennison in 1991. They expanded the hosted guest lodge accommodation to include a vineyard, winery, and restaurant known as Point Bush Estates. Te Kiteroa was a widely-recognised iconic historic homestead, hosting an array of weddings, events and retreats. In 2019, the Dennisons established a predator-fenced 95-hectare ecosanctuary adjacent to Te Kiteroa Lodge, featuring native bush with popular recreational walking and mountain bike tracks. In May 2021, Te Kiteroa sadly succumbed to a devastating fire and was unable to be saved. Gary and Ann were able to reside in one of the cottages, but the loss of their beloved lodge was heartbreaking, a feeling that was shared among many locals.

&nbsp;

<strong>The future
</strong>The new Te Kiteroa Eco Lodge will be a 512sqm eHaus Euro, targeting passive house certification. It will comprise two adjoining but separate wings, together totalling seven bedrooms, each with private bathrooms. The two open-plan kitchen and living areas will be east-facing to the coastline and sunrise. The tranquil setting with stunning views and starry night skies is a legacy that lives on. The eHaus energy-efficiency model aligns well with Gary and Ann’s passion for sustainability and conservation. Te Kiteroa will be one of New Zealand’s healthiest, comfiest, and highest-performing homes. It will have triple glazed windows, be airtight, and require very little energy to heat. Gary and Ann believe this future-focused project is one that their predecessor, Emily Phillips, would wholly approve of.<strong>

With four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a double garage, this home offers ample space for family life. Complemented by an open-plan kitchen, dining, and living area that flows onto paved outdoor spaces, it’s perfect for entertaining or relaxing.

The house is electrified with a 7.7kw battery and solar PV panels which contribute to the predicted heat energy savings of 91%, and rainwater is collected as the main water source, reducing reliance on external sources. The owners set up a KNX home control system which manages the lights, blinds, doors, and ventilation from an app. This intelligent system is connected to a weather station on the garage and automatically adjusts blinds to block out excess sunlight depending on the temperature, ensuring the inside temperature is comfortable without relying on heat pumps or fans for cooling.

While the owners were living overseas, they became accustomed to homes where consistent indoor temperatures were the norm. But when they moved to New Zealand in 2022 and were looking for a place to call home, they were shocked by the temperature fluctuations in a standard house, and with how cold and inefficient many houses here are.

“We realised that building was the only real option if we wanted that same level of comfort and to have an energy efficient house,” the couple said. Determined to build a better home for their family, they chose eHaus Taranaki after seeing what a high performing eHaus could achieve.

Now, their eHaus keeps them warm in winter and cool in summer without any of the typical issues like condensation or big power bills. ""It’s a game-changer,"" says Stefan, describing how their home’s warmth makes even the coldest mornings and mid-night wakeups to kids feel comfortable.

With help from many, the couple have planted over 500 native trees and 50 fruit trees on the property and are building a food forest based on permaculture principles.

The established native trees are a welcome backdrop adjacent to the suburban surroundings. The framed views stretch over planes of Palmerston North, and look beyond to watch the gently turning windmills adorning the peaceful Tararua Ranges. The garage level nestles into the land with a sense of refuge, utilising concrete masonry to anchor the form. This provides a platform for the upper story to delicately float above with its strikingly sleek and minimalist gable forms.

Warmth and daylight is brought into the southern facing view through the separation of the two gable wings, which are gently connected through a glazed link forming the dining room. The exterior decks weave effortlessly between to create a courtyard effect, protected from the prevailing winds.

This energy efficient eHaus seeks to celebrate Japandi principals, using Japanese and Scandinavian design aesthetics which focus on simplicity, natural elements, functionality, comfort, and sustainability. The considered placement on the site, the meandering open plan living, and the blurred sense of interior/exterior reinforces this connection to the earth and nature, and encourages the enjoyment of life’s simple pleasures. The considered spaces of the interior seeks to support a healthy and meaningful lifestyle for those living in this home.

This 250sqm, three-bedroom home is split over two levels, with distinctive floor to ceiling picture windows that make the most of the views out to sea and towards the hills.

In keeping with the home’s commitment to using quality materials, the striking exterior features hardworking Oblique™ Weatherboard by James Hardie which creates a modern aesthetic and helps the upper level stand out. The interior is designed to complement the way the couple like to live and entertain.

The upper level includes the main bedroom and a second living area with a kitchenette to provide independence and privacy when guests are staying.

Downstairs, an open-plan living and dining space opens to a covered patio with heating for year-round use.

The ventilated “closed kitchen” is a distinctive design feature. “It’s like an enlarged scullery. We call it the chef’s kitchen, and it has a sliding door to close it off. It is made for Chinese cooking which usually has strong aromas. We can stop them from wafting through the house as much as possible,” says Jee.

Nothing has been left to chance. The home is pre-wired for an internal lift should it be needed, solar panels on the roof and a 5000-litre water tank means they can be self-sufficient in an emergency.

Built to perform, the home features 278mm thick walls, triple-glazed windows, and exceptional airtightness, delivering year-round comfort and remarkably low energy use.

Inside, the spacious layout includes three bedrooms, with a generous master suite complete with walk-in robe and ensuite. An open-plan kitchen and living area connects to a separate media room and office, offering both space to entertain and quiet corners to retreat. A covered deck extends the living outdoors which is ideal for Marlborough’s long summers.

Designed and built for a couple downsizing from a draughty 1920s bungalow, this home will provide a far more comfortable retirement than their previous home.

Timber soffits soften the modern silhouette, while white plastered cladding and generous glazing give the home a light, expansive feel. A deep covered deck creates a natural outdoor extension of the living area, framed by views of sky and hillside.

The white exterior was purposefully chosen to reflect sunlight away and minimise heat absorption, limiting the need for air conditioning. White roofs are proven to be one of the simplest and most cost effective ways to fight the heat.

Step inside and the tone continues: 2.7m ceilings bring volume to the open-plan kitchen, dining, and lounge space, where custom joinery and timber accents add practical texture. Dual sliding doors extend the living space to the outdoors.

The interior palette is pared back with soft greys and clean white finishes. A walk-in pantry, dedicated laundry and separate powder room round out the functional plan. Although its aesthetic is deliberately restrained, the home performs well above standard. It meets eHaus Pacific benchmarks, including full airtightness, with 140mm framing and insulated, high-performance glazing. A mechanical ventilation system runs continuously to supply fresh, filtered air year-round, and an electric heat pump supplies hot water with no reliance on fossil fuels. The 200sqm home includes two bathrooms, generous storage, and an oversized double garage. Designed with intention and care, it’s a graceful, low-impact home built for lasting comfort.

Built with adventure and flexibility in mind, it supports a lock-and-leave lifestyle, with a low environmental impact. The three-bedroom, two-bathroom dwelling is slung low on its site and includes two living areas plus generous outdoor zones that make the most of the outlook. Expansive sliding doors frame ever-changing lake views and open the home to the horizon, creating a seamless transition between indoors and out. A separate lap pool stretches out behind the house which is a quiet retreat for relaxation or fitness.

Inside, the design is contemporary and inviting. Built-in bookshelves, a copper-toned splashback and natural finishes add depth and character. The main bedroom, which also opens to that view, becomes a front-row seat to watch the shifting light.

As an eHaus Euro, sustainability is built in with airtight construction, heat-recovery ventilation and high-performance joinery. Solar capability and smart-home integration add future-proof functionality. With its resilient materials and enduring sense of place, this home offers year-round comfort and strong design credentials in an exceptional lakeside setting.
