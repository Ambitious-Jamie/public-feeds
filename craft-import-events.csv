<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone is well aware that the NZ building industry has been through a few interesting years. Coming out of Covid in 2021 saw a huge shift, mostly caused by the lowest mortgage rates ever seen in NZ and a building boom, followed by material prices increasing and product shortages. It was a turbulent time, but just as quickly as things turned tough, the good news is that the building industry is changing again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here at eHaus we are starting 2024 with confidence and zest following the recent release of new industry research and data, along with our own insights developed over the last 14 years of business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Join our FREE webinar on Thursday 15 February from 7-8pm and discover why we believe it is a good time to embark on your building journey. In this engaging session, we'll delve into the factors shaping the building industry in 2024 and how eHaus is navigating the landscape this year. In the webinar we will explore:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4>&#x2705; Prices for building materials and price certainty</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4>&#x2705; How annual housing consents are tracking and the impact on builders' capacity</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<h4>&#x2705; Predicted changes for inflation and mortgage rates</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4>&#x2705; Property values and the CoreLogic House Price Index</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you plan to build a new home, don’t be put off by the turbulence of 2020-2023. The market has changed, and we will guide you through how building in 2024 is possible. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

Why do homes overheat? Join our webinar to find out how we design & build to eliminate that risk,overheating-webinar,2025-01-29,1740009600,,https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eHaus-Webinar-Ep.10-1-1-scaled.jpg,https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eHaus-Webinar-Ep.10-1280x400-1-scaled.jpg|https://ehaus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eHaus-Webinar-Ep.10-1280x400-1-1024x320.jpg,,"<!-- wp:image {""id"":17383,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""media""} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Are you concerned about new homes overheating? You're not alone. Recent media coverage and government updates to the H1 Building Code have highlighted these issues, but many of the proposed changes still miss the mark. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By November 2023, the final tranche of MBIE’s changes to the H1 Building Code were in effect. While these updates aimed to make homes more energy efficient, little thought was attributed to managing solar gain in the summer which created an over-heating problem. Ventilation was not adequately considered either, contributing to poor air quality and moisture damage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At eHaus, we know the real problem isn’t too much insulation or high-performing windows—it’s a lack of understanding about how to design homes for year-round comfort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this webinar you will learn about the building science that makes it possible to design and build a comfortable, healthy home no matter where it is built in the country. We’ll explore how:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Homes can maintain a comfortable temperature all year round.</li><li>Fresh, filtered air and no condensation are achievable with good design.</li><li>Energy modelling during the design stage ensures your home avoids overheating and moisture risks.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This approach allows us to predict the risk of overheating with a high degree of accuracy and eliminate any risk at the design stage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ll have a Q&amp;A at the end, and you can submit your questions when you register or send them through during the event.</p>
